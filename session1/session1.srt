ADAM CHLIPALA: Hello,
I'm Adam Chlipala,

5
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,840
Program Chair of ICFP 2020.

6
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,000
And it's my pleasure to kick off our

7
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
first session of contributed talks.

8
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,640
We're making these
available to the public on YouTube.

9
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,040
Though for those of you who've
registered for the conference,

10
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,080
you also have access to an
additional service called Clowdr,

11
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,080
which gives you a more
interactive experience.

12
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,360
So, if you're registering,
but you're not in Clowdr right now,

13
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,920
please head over there
and look for current

14
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,800
and upcoming talk titles
highlighted on the screen.

15
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,960
For instance, right now,
you should see stable relations

16
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,440
and abstract interpretation
for higher order programs

17
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,960
the very next talk. So, you can
click a talk title like that one,

18
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,280
and get the full
interactive experience,

19
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,880
including text chat
during the talk,

20
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,120
and a video Q&A with
the authors afterward.

21
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,800
Actually, you might find the
authors participating alongside you

22
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,640
in both of those because they
prerecorded their talk videos,

23
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,160
So, they can join
the text chat.

24
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,040
Not all authors are
joining the video Q&A

25
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,440
in both the New York and Asia
time bands that we're offering.

26
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,240
So, check Clowdr for links
to Q&A sessions that are happening.

27
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,160
If you don't see the
one you're interested

28
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,600
in for a talk that's playing
now then probably the authors

29
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,560
are on the other time band instead.
Alright, so, I'll remind you of some

30
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,760
of these details as we
progress through the session.

31
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,120
First up, we're going to have
Benoit Montagu telling us

32
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,360
about abstract interpretation
for higher order programs.

33
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,280
BENOIT MONTAGU: Hello, my name
is Benoit Montagu,

34
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,200
and I'm going to tell you about
joint work with Thomas Jensen

35
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,400
about the abstract interpretation
of high order programs.

36
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,880
The problem we're interested in is
the inference of program frames.

37
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,120
This means that
we want to detect

38
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,440
when a function call
does not change.

39
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,520
For imperative programs,
it amounts to finding

40
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,400
which parts of the global state
are not modified by a function call.

41
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,560
For functional programs,
it amounts to finding

42
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,400
which parts of the inputs
and the outputs are the same.

43
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
This frame information
can be used for example,

44
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,160
in optimizing compilers
to perform common

45
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,760
sub expression elimination
and across function calls.

46
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,520
The same information can also

47
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,720
be exploited in
program verification.

48
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,760
In particular, invariant preservation
proves the properties

49
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,080
of the parts
of the Other states

50
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,520
that have not changed
or indeed automatically preserved.

51
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,360
Last year, we published
a paper on what we call

52
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,680
correlation analysis.
It's a static analysis

53
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,360
that infers frames for,
for first order programs.

54
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,280
We applied it to the verification
of an OS micro-kernel.

55
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,800
And it was able
to prove automatically 68%

56
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,240
of the invariant
preservation lemmas.

57
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,080
This means that inferring frames
is really useful in practice.

58
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,600
In this work, we want
to extend the correlation analysis

59
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,280
to infer frames for
a higher order language.

60
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,240
Our long term goal is to
integrate such an analysis

61
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,400
in a general purpose
proof assistant

62
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,360
to make the verification
of large programs easier.

63
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,400
To infer frames
for the lambda calculus,

64
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,040
we follow the methodology
that is offered

65
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,680
by the abstract
interpretation framework.

66
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,400
The first step
is to clearly define

67
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,240
what property
you're interested in.

68
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,320
In this work,
we want to find relations

69
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,760
between the inputs
and the outputs of a lambda term.

70
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,600
The second step
of the methodology

71
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,840
is to define the collecting
semantics for your property.

72
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,560
It describes how
your property evolves

73
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,360
when your program
gets evaluated.

74
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,120
In this work, the collecting
semantics takes the form of

75
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:30,040
a denotation of a lambda term
into input-output relations.

76
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,000
We have proved that this
denotation is sound and complete,

77
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,080
and as a bonus,
you will find in the paper

78
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,240
an equivalent definition
in the form of a program logic.

79
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,520
The third and final step
of the abstract

80
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,800
interpretation methodology
is to apply successive abstractions

81
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,080
on the collecting semantics.
By doing so you obtain an analysis

82
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,960
with which you
can effectively compute.

83
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,320
In this work,
we have used two abstractions.

84
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,840
The first one is
a variant of a well known

85
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,040
independent attribute abstraction,
and the second one introduces

86
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,600
the correlation domain
represented last year,

87
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,640
that we extend to
support first class functions.

88
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,920
What we get in the end
is a simple modular analysis

89
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,600
that is already quite expressive.
And we have mechanically verified

90
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,080
all these results
in the Coq system.

91
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,000
The language we study
in the paper is the untyped call

92
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,080
by value lambda calculus
extended with pairs and binary sums.

93
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,520
The definition of values
in this language

94
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,240
is the standard one
and we use the standard

95
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,280
small step semantics
for call by value

96
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,040
that perform a substitution t,
to reduce a beta redex.

97
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,240
For this for this
higher order language,

98
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,640
we want to infer relations
between the inputs of programs

99
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,440
and the outputs.
But what are the inputs?

100
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,800
We consider the inputs
of a program

101
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,480
are the possible
substitutions sigma

102
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,920
that assign values to
the free variables

103
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,200
of that program.
Then the input output relation

104
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,400
of a term t
for a set of inputs I

105
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,280
is the set of pairs
made from substitutions drawn

106
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,800
from the set of inputs
and the values that are obtained

107
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,400
from evaluating
the term t sigma.

108
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,120
That is t where all its
free variables have been replaced

109
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,040
with the values defined
by the substitution sigma.

110
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,360
With the semantics
of input-output relations,

111
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,880
we can for instance state
that a term t always returns zero

112
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,080
when the input x
is assigned to a negative value

113
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,800
or that t returns a value
that remains above

114
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:42,120
the value of the input x.
Now, we remark that if sigma

115
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,640
might define all the inputs
of a program t,

116
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,760
then you can use
any substitution sigma prime

117
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,640
that defines more inputs,
even some inputs that are

118
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,800
not necessary to t
without changing the meaning

119
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,800
of the program t.
In such a case, we say

120
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,920
that sigma prime
extends sigma.

121
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,000
And because specifying
values for more inputs

122
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,960
than necessary does not change
the meaning of a program

123
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,880
We can actually close
the set of inputs I

124
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,640
under the extension
ordering of substitutions

125
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,040
and by doing so,
the input-output relation

126
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,880
of the term
becomes what we call

127
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,760
a stable relation.
A relation is stable

128
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,440
when if an input
substitution sigma

129
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,840
related to similar
is related to some input v,

130
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,960
then any substitution
that is more defined

131
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,800
than sigma must also
be related to the same value v.

132
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,800
This definition should not
surprise the logicians among you,

133
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,520
what we call stability is similar
to the notion of persistence

134
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,320
that is seen
in Kripke-style semantics.

135
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,440
That is to say, if a property
holds in some world

136
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,880
it will it must also hold
in any larger world.

137
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,880
And the definition should be
no surprise to the semanticists

138
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,680
among you either because
a stable relation is in fact

139
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,440
a monotone function
from substitutions

140
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,240
ordered with
the extension ordering

141
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,080
to sets of values
ordered with set inclusion.

142
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,000
So we have defined
in the paper a denotation

143
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
that's given a term t
and environment E

144
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,960
builds a stable relation
between the inputs

145
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,880
and the outputs of t,
the environment denotes

146
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,480
a set of admissible inputs.
And as expected

147
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,040
in denotational semantics
the denotation function

148
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,080
is defined in a compositional way
by induction over

149
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,200
the syntax of the program.
For example, the denotation

150
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,360
of a program that builds
a pair out of

151
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,240
two sub programs t1 and t2
is the pairing of their denotations.

152
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,560
Here the pairing
of relations relates

153
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,200
an input sigma
to a pair of values,

154
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,920
where the first component
of that value is related

155
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,720
to the input using
the denotation of t1

156
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,360
and the second component
of the value is related

157
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,200
to the same input
using the denotation of t2.

158
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,080
We have proved that
this denotation is sound

159
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,560
with respect to
the input-output in the sense

160
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:12,200
that it is an overall approximation
of the input-output relation

161
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,680
This means that if you take
an input substitution sigma

162
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,880
in the set of valid inputs
described by the environment,

163
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,200
and if the evaluation
of the program t

164
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,520
with these inputs
gives you an output value v,

165
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,920
then the input-output pair
(sigma, v) is predicatively

166
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,880
in the denotation
of the program.

167
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,920
Interestingly, the denotation
we have defined is also complete.

168
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,880
This means that
the denotation

169
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,000
of the input-output relation
are the same.

170
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,000
We have mechanically
verified these results

171
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,520
in the Coq proof systems...
A denotation must treat

172
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,440
variables very carefully
and here is why.

173
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,520
You should expect
that the denotation

174
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,960
of a variable is just a lookup
for the variable in the environment.

175
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,120
This is indeed
a correct over-approximation

176
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,840
Within the paper we give
a sound and complete definition.

177
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,120
Here it is. I will not
explain all the details,

178
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,200
but just notice that the definition
uses a relation self (x).

179
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,640
This relation states that
the output must be exactly

180
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,600
what was given
as input for the variable x.

181
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,040
In particular, this means that
the denotation of the variable x

182
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,400
is a relation in which
the variable x occurs.

183
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,520
In other words,
the denotation of a term

184
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,080
may involve
the names of its inputs.

185
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,240
This means that
the semantic denotations

186
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,080
can refer to syntactic variables.
This has consequences

187
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,480
on the well-formedness,
of the definition,

188
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,600
you need to show for example,
that the free variables

189
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,440
of your denotations
are included in the variables

190
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,800
that are defined
by the environment.

191
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,200
But what does it even mean

192
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,520
to be a free variable
for a relation?

193
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,400
Relations are semantic objects
not pieces of syntax.

194
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,880
And to answer this question
We use nominal techniques

195
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,840
to carefully handle names.
If you want to dive

196
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,000
into the details, please
have a look at the paper.

197
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,320
Now how do we
handle functions?

198
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,040
Let's start with
function application.

199
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,600
The denotation of t1
applied to t2

200
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,000
is the app
of the denotations.

201
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,600
This is a relation
where,when you take values

202
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,320
in the denotations of t1 and t2
and apply them together,

203
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,960
you must obtain
a term that evaluates to a value v.

204
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,000
And this result value v
must be the value

205
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,680
in the final denotation.
That's it for applications.

206
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,160
Now for functions,
I won't have time to show you

207
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,520
the full definition
of the denotation

208
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,200
but you should remember that
it can be over approximated

209
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,920
by a relation that
assuming some condition

210
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,160
on the arguments,
gives you the denotation

211
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:07,480
of the functions body.
Here is the unfolded definition

212
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,080
where I have chosen to hide
some pieces related

213
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,280
to name management.
Let's go through it.

214
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,280
This is a relation where the output
is supposed to be a function

215
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,960
for which we will consider
all possible applications.

216
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,440
When we apply this function
to an argument v1

217
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,480
that satisfies the condition R,
if the evaluation

218
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,840
gives a result v2, then v2
must be in the denotation

219
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,040
of the function body.
But the arguments

220
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,360
and results must be valid
for all possible extensions

221
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,600
of the input substitutions,
as is usually from

222
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,760
the in Kripke style semantics.
And this is essential

223
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,640
because this quantification
of our extensions

224
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,480
of the inputs is the reason
that makes definition

225
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:57,040
a stable relation. In the end,
we have a modular

226
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,360
denotation rule for functions
that we later use

227
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,600
as a basis for
the modular analysis of functions.

228
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,520
So we have
defined this denotation

229
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,880
is collecting semantics
that describes exactly

230
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,800
the input output
behavior of programs.

231
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,200
And we use it as a starting point
to build a static analysis.

232
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,000
So following the abstract
interpretation methodology,

233
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,040
we applied successive
abstraction steps.

234
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,200
So far our denotation
tells us how the inputs

235
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,720
are related to the outputs globally.
We first apply a invariant

236
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,720
of the independent
attribute abstraction,

237
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,560
working at this point
what we call point-wise relations,

238
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,320
that, that tell us how each input
is independently related

239
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,720
to the output.
For each input x,

240
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,760
we obtain a binary relation
on values, that says

241
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,880
how sigma of x is related
to the output v.

242
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Then, we abstract
these binary relations on values

243
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,400
into an abstract domain
that we call correlations,

244
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,400
and with which
we can effectively compute.

245
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,560
This abstract domain
is an extension

246
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,720
of the correlation of subdomain
from our previous work

247
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,640
that we extended
with first class functions.

248
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,640
You will find plenty of details
on how we did this in the...

249
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,320
...paper.

250
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,560
We implemented the resulting
analysis in OCaml.

251
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,680
This is a bottom-up modular analyzer

252
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,480
that analyses functions only once.

253
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,040
For every function, it
computes a function summary

254
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,600
that approximates the extensional
behavior of that function.

255
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,280
The analysis was really not
designed to compete with

256
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:39,120
existing control flow analysis
and it does not compete.

257
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,960
Still, it can give
very precise results

258
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,440
even though it follows
a fully modular approach.

259
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,520
Let's consider this
classic CFA example.

260
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,760
This program calls
the identity function twice

261
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,560
on two different arguments and returns
the result of one of the calls.

262
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,320
It's an example where 0-CFA
is not precise enough

263
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,920
and 1-CFA is required to
achieve good precision.

264
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,000
The analyzer first computes
a summary for the identity function.

265
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,960
The summary tells us
that this is a function

266
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,000
whose result is equal to its argument
whatever is the calling context.

267
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,320
This summary is instantiated
once for the first application.

268
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,240
We get that y1 must be bound
to the first injection.

269
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,440
Then, the summary is
instantiated the second time

270
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,960
for the second application and

271
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,360
the analysis tells us that y2 must
be bound to the second injection.

272
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,360
Finally, the analysis
for the results

273
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,120
is the domain we have
obtained for y1,

274
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,920
that is to say it has to
be the first injection.

275
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,920
On this example, we can
see that the analysis

276
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,160
gives the most precise results
and is on par with 1-CFA.

277
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,480
To wrap up, we have defined
solid foundations for the

278
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,720
relational analysis of
higher-order programs

279
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,840
by means of a sound
and complete relational semantics

280
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,440
for the lambda calculus.

281
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,280
We exploited this collecting semantics
to design an effective analysis

282
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:09,240
and we provide an artifact
for the Coq formalization

283
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,400
of the theoretical development.

284
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,480
As a long-term goal, we would
like to integrate such analysis

285
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,120
with a proof assistant to
reduce the proof efforts

286
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,520
for the verification of
large programs.

287
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,800
On the shorter term, we want to
support more language features

288
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,280
and to increase
the precision of the analysis,

289
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,040
for example by exploiting
numeric abstract domains.

290
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,960
Finally, we are convinced
that our denotational semantics

291
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,320
can serve as a basis
for the future design

292
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,360
of novel relational
control flow analysis.

293
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,000
That's all. Thank you for watching.

294
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:51,520
(AUDIENCE CLAP)

295
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,000
ADAM: Thanks Benoit.

296
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,640
If you're watching in
the New York time band,

297
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,600
you should now see a link
appear in Clowdr

298
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,560
to join a video chat where you
can ask Benoit questions.

299
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,040
Unfortunately, he is not
available in the Asia time band.

300
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,040
OK. Let's get started
with the next talk.

301
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,640
We have Scott Smith on symbolic
evaluation of functional languages.

302
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,720
SCOTT SMITH: Welcome to our talk on

303
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,400
Higher-Order Demand-Driven
Symbolic Evaluation.

304
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,760
Let's parse this title a bit.

305
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,640
Particularly, what is
meant by demand-driven?

306
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,360
Demand-driven means goal-directed.

307
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,640
So, rather than working forward,

308
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,440
we're going to start with
a goal and work backward.

309
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,240
And this is well-known from logic
programming and tactic-based provers

310
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,800
where it's clear where your goal is.

311
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,720
And so, it's best to start from
that goal and work backward

312
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,000
rather than trying to forward-chain,

313
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,760
although, sometimes
forward-chain is good,

314
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,840
generally you're... shooting
in the dark a lot of times

315
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,840
and you're very far
away from your target.

316
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,800
So, goal-directed is
clearly a win there

317
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,400
and it's the common approach.

318
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,880
Now, if we look at program analysis,

319
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,800
symbolic executors and interpreters,

320
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,440
it's more the opposite
that tends to be...

321
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,160
You don't have a

322
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,160
fixed narrow
goal in this space.

323
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,440
It tends to be one around
the whole program in all these cases.

324
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,160
So, they tend to be forward.

325
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,240
But there are some cases when

326
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,920
demand is useful
if we have a particular

327
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,760
part of the program you want to
get a very accurate result on

328
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,520
and a

329
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,080
demand program analysis
could be effective

330
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,680
and you don't have to go
through all the work

331
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,280
on the whole program.

332
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,880
And so, Reps and collaborators wrote
a series of influential papers

333
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,720
doing this in
the imperative language space

334
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,240
and there have been a few efforts
in the functional space -

335
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,520
one is DDPA which is our work,

336
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,160
so, there are bends on functional

337
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,240
demand

338
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,840
program analysis. And in
the symbolic execution

339
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,560
space, snugglebug is an imperative
demand symbolic executor

340
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,720
and this paper is basically
about filling in this box

341
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:04,000
with DDSE which is our functional
demand symbolic executor.

342
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,560
And to do a functional
demand symbolic executor,

343
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,360
we need an interpreter which is demand
in which we're going to symbolize.

344
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,480
And so, we're also going to present
DDI which is a new notion

345
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,560
of functional interpreter and

346
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,280
it is novel and has no substitution,
environment or closures

347
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,360
because you can't...

348
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,760
These data structures are built
on the forward direction

349
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,320
and we're not running forward.

350
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,720
And so, the interpreter itself
is pretty interesting.

351
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,480
And so, the outline of the talk

352
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,720
is we're going to briefly talk
about the language syntax.

353
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,160
Then, we're going to do
this, novel interpreter.

354
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,320
And then, we're going to show
how it can be generalized

355
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,880
to a symbolic evaluator.

356
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,680
And then, we're going to look at
our implementation very briefly.

357
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,440
So, the syntax we have is
pretty standard, very simple,

358
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,640
functional language in our theory.

359
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,360
And we're going to have input because

360
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,760
the way we're going to test
our symbolic evaluators

361
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,040
is we're going to find

362
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,040
inputs for each particular
line of the program

363
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,560
and that's sort of our concrete

364
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,760
goal to show that the method works.

365
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,920
And recursion is this
encoded via self-passing

366
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,120
and the implementation also
has additional features

367
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,800
such as recursive data structures.

368
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,920
And the syntax we
use is A-normal Form

369
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,800
and this is an example
and you can see in A-normal Form,

370
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,360
every operator

371
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,840
the components are all atomic
and this exposes the order

372
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,200
which is very useful because

373
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,920
we're going to be running
programs backwards.

374
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,160
So, reading right to
left is very handy

375
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,160
to know the order more explicitly.

376
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:39,160
And also, variable names are unique.
So, here we have x, y and ret.

377
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,600
And those serve as
the program points because

378
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,760
they're unique.

379
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,000
So, there's...

380
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,280
We'll use that to name
points in a program.

381
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,440
So,

382
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,960
the main function we want to
find is a lookup function.

383
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,920
And the lookup function, we want
to find the value of a variable.

384
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,800
So, that's the variable
we want to lookup.

385
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,120
That's the point at which we want to
start in the program to look it up.

386
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,480
And this one parameter, we'll talk
more about, is the call stack

387
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,240
which we use to disambiguate
different activations

388
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,720
and the final result is a v.

389
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,880
(CLEARS THROAT)

390
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,160
So, yes, this is the program point.

391
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,640
Call stack.

392
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,000
In general, this is
going to be a list,

393
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,720
but for now, we're just
covering the case

394
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,960
where it's a singleton.

395
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,520
And the idea is we're just going to
walk back through the program,

396
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,960
define the variable

397
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,960
as the intuition.

398
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,920
So, here the variable y, if we
actually add this definition,

399
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,840
it's axiomatic that the value is 1,

400
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,480
but if we're down here
at this line f1...

401
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,640
So, remember the line we're
looking up from the program point.

402
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:44,320
So, define y. This y, we basically
can search back up through here

403
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,120
and we'll find it up here.

404
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,080
And more interesting if we're in

405
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,400
for example, this variable x here,

406
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,680
the only way we're going to
reach that is that via call

407
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,080
from one of these call sites.

408
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,800
And here, this disambiguates
which call we took.

409
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,800
So, we're in the call f1.
That's how we got there.

410
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,240
And we are pretty clear
if we're looking up x.

411
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,200
From the call f1, x is
the argument passed in as y

412
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,600
and then, we can look up
y and in turn get 1.

413
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,160
So, 1 is result of that.

414
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,280
So, let's go through that in detail

415
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,440
how we traced that call.

416
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,480
So, a little more about how
the actual lookup function works.

417
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,520
And so, to lookup f1,

418
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,840
at this point, we know that it's
the return result of the function f.

419
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:32,000
So, it suffices to lookup
the return variable fret in that code

420
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,440
at the last line of
code which is fret.

421
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,480
So, we're looking up from
the point that we're pointing to

422
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,760
and we're looking up that variable

423
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,040
and the value is immediately
there. It's right in front of us.

424
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,360
And by the way, we have
pushed a call frame

425
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,080
because we're in this
call. So, f1 means the

426
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,640
the call frame that we're
in on the call stack.

427
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,040
And so, it suffices

428
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,520
for fret, clearly, it's x+1.

429
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,360
So, I get is lookup x and add
1 to it and have our results.

430
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,160
So, we're going to lookup x.
That's the underlying lookup.

431
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,640
So, looking up x

432
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,040
from the top of the function,

433
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,880
at this point now it's pretty clear

434
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,760
that since we came
in via the call f1,

435
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,040
we know that we came
in this call here

436
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,720
and the parameter y is
what gets passed to x.

437
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,440
So, just look up x, it
suffices to look up y

438
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,920
from the top of
the program, the empty stack

439
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,200
and that pretty
clearly is going to be 1.

440
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,960
And the final result
is 1+1 which is 2.

441
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,280
So, that's a simple lookup.

442
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,600
And a little more complicated case
is if we have non-local variables.

443
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,800
And here's a simple example of
a curried addition function

444
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,320
and let's start in
the middle of this look up.

445
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,520
So, we want to lookup the value of x.

446
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,920
And this is the tricky case
because it's a non-local variable.

447
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,000
This is defined all the way out here

448
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,240
and the way we got that - the way
we're actually going to run this code

449
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,760
if we get the program, it's going to
be from this call site here

450
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,480
because first, we got 5 for x
and 1 for y and then, we're going to

451
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,920
do this call, in which
case we're in this code.

452
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,680
So, that means that we
had to have come in

453
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,000
via this call site,

454
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,720
ret call site here. So, this
is an example of where we

455
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,080
could have gotten to

456
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,680
you know, lookup from the end
of the program for example.

457
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,400
And so, we're at that line
here gyret, its definition

458
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,000
we want to find the value of x.

459
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,480
So, how do we do?

460
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,200
Well, x is not in scope but

461
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,560
the principle of lexical scoping
is the function we are running

462
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,920
i.e. this function here,
gret, we know that the

463
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,440
x variable must have been in scope

464
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,440
when that function was defined

465
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,000
as you can see.

466
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,880
It's in scope at
the function definition point.

467
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,720
And so, what we do is we know that
that function is the value of g5

468
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,440
because that's
the function we called -

469
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,320
this is the call site
we came from, ret

470
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,240
and that function g5
is called. So, the...

471
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,920
What we do is we write
a lookup like this which means

472
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,520
let's first look for
the function definition

473
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,720
for g5's code is

474
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,880
and then, pop up that off
and resume a lookup for x.

475
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,200
And we should find it in that point.

476
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,760
So, let's do that.

477
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,120
(CLEARS THROAT)

478
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,480
So, define g5, in fact is
the return result of this call.

479
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,400
So, we want to pop into g
body and look for gret

480
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,680
which will be the value of g5.

481
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,480
So, to look up g5, it suffices to
look at gret from within this call

482
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,840
at this line.

483
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,720
So, let's do that and to define

484
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,080
define gret,

485
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,680
well, it's right
there - we found it.

486
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,880
It's the last line

487
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,080
of

488
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,240
the

489
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,400
code. So, all we have to do now

490
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,760
is

491
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,440
to pop

492
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,360
this frame of a stack and

493
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,440
resume looking up for
x and look, we win,

494
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,000
x is within scope now.

495
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,760
So, in fact, it should be very
easy to find the value of x.

496
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:59,200
It in fact is the parameter
at the call site g5

497
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,600
which in fact is 5.

498
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,000
So, that's the answer.

499
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,280
And so, in general, the lookup,

500
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,640
if we have higher
and higher order functions,

501
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,480
this list can grow longer and longer

502
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,560
but this is the full general
signature of our lookup.

503
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,680
So, it has two lists of
variables basically

504
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,720
and that's all of the
structure of this interpreter.

505
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,520
And here are the full rules.

506
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,680
You can see there's...

507
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,320
It's a lot more complicated
than the pure lambda calculus.

508
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,160
So, there are a lot of subtleties
here but that's fit on the slide

509
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,400
so it's not hopelessly complex.

510
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,840
So, let's now look at how we make
a symbolic version of this.

511
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,280
So, it's very similar parameters

512
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,160
and instead of returning a value,
you're returning a variable

513
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,880
which in then in the constraints,

514
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,640
we also have the constraints set

515
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,400
and that is we're going to
constrain that variable

516
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,440
to have some properties

517
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
(CLEARS THROAT)

518
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,920
which we can then use
an SMT solver to find

519
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,520
an actual solution for...

520
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,160
And so, yeah, so this S here
means the symbolic version

521
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,080
of lookups.

522
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:04,000
So, let's run that on the same example,
the same lookup of f1's value.

523
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
So, we go into fret
and look up fret's value

524
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,760
and we can immediately see
it's right there. It's x+1.

525
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,320
So, actually, this time we're
going to return a variable

526
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,440
and remember variables are
indexed by the call stack.

527
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,320
So, this variable's indexed by

528
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,080
f1 in this case,

529
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,080
'cause that's how we came
into this function.

530
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,720
So that's in fact
the result of the lookup.

531
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,280
So we've done
the result of looking up,

532
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:33,560
but additionally, we have a constraint
which requires this variable

533
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,880
to have the value of whatever
x's lookup is plus one.

534
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,560
And remember this lookup here is
in turn going to return a variable.

535
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,600
So let's proceed with that
lookup and see what it returns.

536
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,760
So to lookup x from this point here,

537
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:52,400
it suffices to look up the parameter
of the call site, that call site was f1,

538
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,840
so the parameter is y
so it suffices to look up y

539
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,840
and if we see, if we go up, we see
y is up at the top of the program.

540
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,080
It's in fact an input.

541
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,280
So this is, by the way,
use of the input syntax

542
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,160
and inputs are unconstrained because
there's, they could be arbitrary.

543
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,120
And so in the symbolic execution,

544
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,880
we just return the variable
with no added constraints.

545
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,720
So that means that
the final constraint set

546
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,440
is that this fret equals
this lookup here,

547
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,440
which returned just the value
y in the empty stack plus one

548
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,440
so we get that.

549
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,000
That's the only constraint on
this very simple example.

550
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,640
And it's clear there are many
satisfiable solutions to it.

551
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,400
So that's an example of
a symbolic execution.

552
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:37,400
So in the paper, we make
a formal operational semantics

553
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,240
for all these systems.

554
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,160
And the main result we prove
the most difficult result

555
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,680
is that a backward running
demand operational semantics,

556
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,600
this lookup operation
is in fact isomorphic

557
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,800
to a forward running
operational semantics.

558
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,920
And it's a delicate proof

559
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,040
because they're running
in opposite directions.

560
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,320
And we also proved that the symbolic
evaluator is sound and complete

561
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,080
with respect to
the operational semantics.

562
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,560
And a few subtle details that we
have to skip because of time

563
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,320
is that the call stack, when
we're starting in the middle,

564
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,360
we really want to
start in the middle

565
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,680
'cause that's what
domain lookup means.

566
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,680
We want to start from any
point and you might not,

567
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,640
you will have no idea if the call
stack when you start that run

568
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,440
and we may need to
incrementally infer

569
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,280
where the call stack is as we go.

570
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,000
And also input will not come
in their forward order

571
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,680
when we're doing a reverse lookup

572
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,840
and we need to basically do
a sorting operation on the input

573
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,800
and that's all in the paper.

574
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,920
So for implementation, the artifact
we produce is a test generator.

575
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,600
So given a program
and a target line,

576
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,680
we will find inputs which reach
that target line of code.

577
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,960
And we have an initial proof-of-concept
implementation in OCaml.

578
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,080
And in order to make
it usable at all,

579
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,720
we have to dovetail on all
the different search paths,

580
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,840
or we get lost down
some infinite path.

581
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:00,120
And so we use a coroutine
non-determinism monad for that purpose.

582
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,240
And just to test it
out a little bit,

583
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,840
there is a paper that has
a forward symbolic evaluator in it,

584
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:11,080
and we basically solve
the benchmarks from that paper

585
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,560
just sort of as a test to make
sure our system is reasonable.

586
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,960
And to compare very
briefly with related work,

587
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,680
so snugglebug is an imperative
demand symbolic executer.

588
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,800
The Cruanes work that
we just mentioned

589
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,640
is a forward functional
symbolic executer.

590
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,000
And it also has restrictions.

591
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,280
For example, all functions
have to be total

592
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,600
which we don't have in our system.

593
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,240
And Rosette is another forward
symbolic execution framework.

594
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,320
And it has some restrictions on

595
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,240
data types not being
arbitrarily sized.

596
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,120
And our work has,

597
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:54,080
it's the first that we know of demand
functional symbolic evaluator,

598
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,240
and it has no restrictions
on datatypes or recursion,

599
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,440
and we've proven it sound
and complete. Thank you.

600
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
(APPLAUSE)

601
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,880
ADAM: Thanks, Scott.

602
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,960
In either time band, you should
see a link appearing in Cloud

603
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,560
or to join a live Q&A session with
at least one of the authors.

604
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,840
Alright, next up is Kazutaka Matsuda

605
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,960
on A language for partially
invertible computations.

606
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,040
KAZUTAKA MATSUDA: Hello, I'm Kazutaka
Matsuda from Tohoku University.

607
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,480
Today I'd like to introduce our
new programming language, SPARCL,

608
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,280
which is a language for partially
invertible computation.

609
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,000
SPARCL is named after a system for
partially invertible computation

610
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,760
with linear types.

611
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,960
Let us start with a background:
Invertible Programming.

612
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,000
Invertibility is a common
and important concept

613
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
in software development.

614
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,360
For example, we have
compression and decompression.

615
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,840
We have undoing and redoing.

616
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,120
We have serialization
and deserialization.

617
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,480
Invertible programming

618
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,520
is a way to provide
correctness by construction.

619
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,120
Then natural question arises.

620
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:19,120
For normal programming the basic
building blocks are functions,

621
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:24,840
but for invertible programming, what
should be the building blocks?

622
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,160
Our obvious approach is to use

623
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,200
invertible function for
invertible programming.

624
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,760
However, this approach
is restrictive

625
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,480
because invertible functions
have to be injective,

626
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,440
but it is known that some
functions become invertible

627
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,480
after fixing some argument.

628
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,800
These functions are called
partially invertible functions.

629
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:55,400
An example of a partially invertible
function is an addition,

630
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:02,160
which becomes invertible after
fixing either of the arguments.

631
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,560
A more practical example of
a partial invertible function

632
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,240
is Huffman encoding,

633
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,760
which becomes invertible after
fixing Huffman encoding table.

634
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,800
And saying, a question is,

635
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,480
is it possible to do
invertible programming

636
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,320
through a partially-invertible
programming?

637
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:26,960
If so, what is a language for
partially-invertible programming?

638
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,960
This paper answer to this question.

639
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,680
With designer SPARCL,

640
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,120
which is a programming language
for writing invertible functions

641
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,840
through composing
partially-invertible function.

642
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,680
This is because
partially-invertible functions

643
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,560
are more natural and more expressive.

644
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,280
SPARCL uses linear types,

645
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,600
which is a key to
correctness by construction.

646
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,760
Let us start with an example
to explain the problem

647
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,920
and solution in more detail.

648
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,320
Consider a function
that compute difference

649
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,960
of adjacent element in a list.

650
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,600
Starting from zero, this function
repeatedly compute a difference

651
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,480
from a previous element.

652
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,320
For example, the difference
between one and zero is one,

653
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,200
so it output one.

654
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,400
And the difference between two
and one is one, so it output one.

655
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,560
The different between
five and two is three,

656
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,520
so it outputs three and so on.

657
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,400
This is very simple
function, but indeed useful.

658
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,360
Actually, a variant of this
function can be used

659
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,960
as a pre-processing for image
compression, as found in PNG.

660
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,040
The standard unidirectional
implementation

661
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,600
of this transformation
looks like this.

662
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,320
The subs take a list of int
and returns a list of int.

663
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,280
This function calls go with
additional arguments zero

664
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,040
which intuitively represent
a previous element.

665
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:03,440
Go takes int and a list of int
and returns a list of int.

666
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:08,200
If you apply go into the empty
list, it returns an empty list.

667
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:13,400
If you apply go into x
cons xs, it outputs x-n

668
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,160
and recurs it over x and xs.

669
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,000
Here, we have some observation
about invertibility of subs.

670
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,600
First of all, subs
itself is invertible.

671
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,200
Actually, we can recover
the original input from this result

672
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,360
by using a cumulative summation.

673
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:39,040
For example, sum of
this elements is one

674
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,800
and sum of these two
elements is two.

675
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,520
Sum of these three elements
is five and so on.

676
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,040
However, go, sorry.

677
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,320
However, subs itself is,

678
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:55,600
subs does not consist only
of invertible functions.

679
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:01,080
In fact, go is not invertible
but partially-invertible.

680
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:07,680
Specifically go n becomes invertible
for any fixed or a static n.

681
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,280
This means that we
need to care about

682
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,760
partial invertibility
in programming go.

683
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,640
This example also illustrates

684
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,240
a challenge in partial
invertible programming,

685
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,320
that is, dynamic data flow
into a static position.

686
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,240
Here, we highlight
the dynamic part with blue.

687
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,320
Here, x, which is dynamic,

688
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:44,840
flows into the first argument
go, which is static,

689
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:50,280
because that go becomes invertible
after fixing its first argument.

690
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,840
To overcome the situation,

691
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:57,960
we propose a SPARCL a language for
partially-invertible computation.

692
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:02,400
SPARCL comes with linear
types and invertible types.

693
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,240
Invertible types denoted
by A superscript R.

694
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,120
Intuitively it means A-typed values

695
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,600
that has to be handled
only in invertible ways.

696
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,680
Thanks to invertible types,

697
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:24,240
invertible functions are represented
as ordinary linear functions

698
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,640
between invertible types
in SPARCL like this.

699
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:32,640
This representation provide
a unified framework

700
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:37,000
for describing invertible
and partial invertible function.

701
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,560
For example, here we showed
the types of subs and go in SPARCL.

702
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:47,360
Because subs is invertible function.

703
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:54,160
In SPARCL subs take invertible list of int
and it returns an invertible list of int.

704
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,840
Because that go is
a partially-invertible function,

705
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:01,560
which becomes invertible after
fixing its first argument.

706
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:06,440
Int SPARCL go takes
ordinary int and a list,

707
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,400
invertible list of int
and returns a invertible list of int.

708
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,480
SPARCL also provides a pin operator

709
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,520
to bridge invertible
and ordinary worlds.

710
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,200
By using pin operator,

711
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,800
we can convert invertible
values into ordinary values

712
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,360
locally in this continuation.

713
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,560
Recall that it sometimes
happens that dynamic data flow

714
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,040
into static position,

715
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:36,120
which is a challenge in
partially-invertible programming.

716
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,720
This pin operator is
a remedy for this situation.

717
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,640
Let us start with
very simple example

718
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,560
to explain programming
basics in SPARCL.

719
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:51,280
SPARCL is a linear typed, higher-order
functional programming language,

720
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,640
only the special thing is
that it has invertible types.

721
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:00,040
Here we explain how we handle
values of invertible types.

722
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,360
Here is a partial invertible
addition written in SPARCL.

723
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,520
This definition is very similar to

724
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,040
the standard unidirectional version.

725
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:18,320
But here our function takes
ordinary natural number

726
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,800
and invertible natural number

727
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,240
and returns an invertible
natural number

728
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,200
to highlight its
partial invertibility.

729
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:32,400
To construct invertible
natural number

730
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,680
instead of using
ordinary constructors,

731
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:41,240
we use lifted constructors,
such as S superscript R.

732
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:48,600
Here, which shows
the partially-invertible multiplication

733
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,760
defined in SPARCL.

734
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:55,640
Multiplication is similar
to the sub add function,

735
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:00,520
takes natural numbers,
and invertible natural numbers

736
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,040
and return invertible
natural number.

737
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,440
Unlike the add function,

738
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:13,600
the mul function uses case analysis
of invertible natural numbers.

739
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:17,200
To do so, it uses
invertible branching

740
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:22,560
indicated by invertible
patterns like Z superscript R

741
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,840
and S y superscript R.

742
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,960
A special thing in
invertible branching

743
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:34,120
is a branch comes with condition.

744
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:41,360
This with conditions are using SPARCL
direction to determine branches

745
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,640
but we do not describe
the details in this talk.

746
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,160
Now we are ready to show how
we program subs in SPARCL.

747
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,160
Because subs is a function
that computes the values

748
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,320
of adjacent element in a list.

749
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,680
For comparison, we'll also show

750
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,640
the standard unidirectional
definition of subs in Haskell.

751
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,080
So definition of the two
programs look very similar

752
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:15,760
except the use of constructs
that care about Invertibility.

753
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,520
Subs in SPARCL take
an invertible list of INT

754
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,760
and return invertible list of INT.

755
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,600
Surprisingly the right hand side
of the SPARCL function sub

756
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,280
is identical to
unidirectional version.

757
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,400
The go in SPARCL takes ordinary INT

758
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,120
and invertible list of INT
and returns invertible list of INT.

759
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,360
To manipulate invertible
list INT, the go function

760
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:55,120
uses lifted constructors
and invertible branching.

761
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,520
The most important part
in the definition is

762
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,520
that it uses the pin operator.

763
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:08,680
By using the pin operator, we
convert x of type invertible INT

764
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,640
into z of type ordinary INT.

765
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:18,400
Thanks to this conversion, we
can call go for z and xs.

766
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,960
Because that's
the first argument of go,

767
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,600
expect INT instead
of invertible INT.

768
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:33,240
We say again that two
programs look very similar.

769
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:37,240
In this, they have
the same recursive structure.

770
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,880
This is a strength of
SPARCL compared with

771
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,160
existing reversible languages.

772
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,000
Once we have defined
invertible function,

773
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,640
we can use it by using
the forward and backward functions.

774
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,280
Here fwd is a function

775
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,440
that runs an invertible function
in the forward direction.

776
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,920
And bwd that the opposite.

777
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:07,000
For example, if we apply
fwd subs to this list,

778
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,040
we will obtain this result.

779
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,720
And if we apply, bwd
subs to this list,

780
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,160
we will obtain
the original list again.

781
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:21,080
Indeed, our pair of fwd subs
and bwd subs forms a bijection.

782
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,640
This is what SPARCL guarantees.

783
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,960
This is a brief
introduction to SPARCL.

784
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,360
But in our paper, we...

785
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,840
we discussed more things.

786
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,960
For example, we defined
the class system

787
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,680
lambda PI arrow of SPARCL.

788
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,160
Now lambda PI arrow is
based on linear calculus,

789
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:47,760
and lambda q arrow features
a class system of linear Haskell.

790
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,160
So the design of lambda
PI arrow is also

791
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,160
inspired by two-staged languages.

792
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,440
We shall see some formal properties
about lambda PI arrow

793
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,120
including type
safety and bijectivity.

794
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:03,840
We'll also discuss larger
examples including Huffman encoding

795
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:07,120
and calculation of developed
native tree rebuilding

796
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,720
from in order and
preorder traversal.

797
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,040
Let us discuss some of related work.

798
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,560
These are some existing research

799
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,000
concerning partial invertibility.

800
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,160
In program transformation,
there's an inversion method

801
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:24,160
called partial, impartial
and semi-inversion.

802
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,400
Also there are some reverse
programming languages

803
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,680
that support a limited form of
partial invertibility.

804
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:40,000
The design of SPARCL is inspired
by our previous work HOBiT.

805
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,920
HOBiT is a higher-order
bidirectional programming language

806
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,720
in which lenses are already
presented as ordinary function.

807
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,800
More specifically
Lens between S and T

808
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:54,680
is represented as an ordinary
function between B S and B T.

809
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,080
Here, B S and B T are

810
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,640
very similar to invertible
types in SPARCL.

811
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,920
But HOBiT does not use linear types

812
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,560
and it does not provide
a pin operator,

813
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:13,120
which is very useful in partially
invertible programming.

814
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,800
Let us conclude our talk.

815
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,320
We designed SPARCL,
a programming language

816
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,600
for writing invertible functions

817
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,800
through composing
partially-invertible functions.

818
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,840
Because partially-invertible
functions

819
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,240
are more natural
and more expressive.

820
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,800
SPARCL uses linear types,

821
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:36,040
which is the key to
correctness by construction.

822
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,160
Thank you.

823
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:44,960
(APPLAUSE)

824
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,080
ADAM: Thanks Kazutaka.

825
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,120
In either time band,

826
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,920
you should see a Q&A
link appear in Clowdr

827
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,120
that brings you to a video chat,

828
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,120
where you can ask
Kazutaka your questions.

829
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,240
Welcome back for a talk
by Aymeric Fromherz

830
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,600
on Concurrent Separation Logic
in the F* Programming Language.

831
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,480
AYMERIC FROMHERZ: Hi. I'm Aymeric

832
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,840
and it's my pleasure to be here
today to present our work on,

833
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,560
SteelCore: An Extensible
Concurrent Separation Logic

834
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,600
for Effectful Dependent Programs.

835
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,360
Our goal in this work is to
verify concurrent programs.

836
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,160
And there has been
lots of recent work

837
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,440
on this topic,

838
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,760
especially on using Concurrent
Separation Logic (CSL)

839
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,760
for verification.

840
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:31,080
But our main success stories
is the Iris project,

841
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,480
which provides a comprehensive
expressive logic

842
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,040
to reason about
concurrent programs.

843
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,560
Unfortunately, it only
applies to deeply embedded,

844
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:43,040
simply-typed languages and we
really do enjoy dependent types.

845
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,480
We really do enjoy, for instance,

846
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,680
the use in type theory based proof assistants,

847
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,280
which allow us to combine
modular reasoning

848
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,480
with strong abstractions
and strong specifications.

849
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,560
So one question, we
asked ourselves is

850
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,280
how could we get
a Concurrent Separation Logic

851
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,120
for a dependently-typed language?

852
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,440
Could, for instance,
a shallow embedding work?

853
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,720
But it comes with
certain challenges.

854
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,120
The first one is how do
we actually reflect

855
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,840
the effect of concurrency in
our dependently-typed language?

856
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,640
The second is how do we
support partial correctness,

857
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,240
which is needed when
reasoning with programs

858
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,280
that might have deadlocks
and that might not terminate?

859
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,120
And lastly, IRIS provides this
very convenient feature

860
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,440
to reason about
concurrent programs

861
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,560
called dynamically
allocated invariants.

862
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,640
How do we support these things

863
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,880
in a dependently-typed language?

864
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,680
And I'll come back to
that a bit later.

865
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,640
To verify concurrent programs, we've
been developing

866
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,680
a framework called Steel,

867
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,480
which is a concurrency
version, which is DSL for F*,

868
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,520
an effectful dependently-typed
language designed for verification.

869
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,440
And in this talk, I'm going to
talk especially about Steel core,

870
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,080
which consists of the core
semantics and program logic

871
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,480
of the Steel framework.

872
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,440
So at the very bottom
of Steelcore,

873
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,760
we have a model of computations
using action trees.

874
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:58,280
And these action trees are
characterized by state typeclass,

875
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:02,120
which abstracts memory as well
the structure of the separation logic.

876
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,320
And for these action
trees, we provide

877
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,920
an intrinsically typed
definitional interpreter.

878
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,880
And one of the interesting
things about how we get

879
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,440
intrinsically typed here
is that this allows us to,

880
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,960
reasonably to prove
a soundness of our semantics,

881
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:21,120
without having to rely on
explicit execution traces.

882
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,800
We then instantiate
this state typeclass

883
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,360
of a rich Concurrent
Separation Logic.

884
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:29,000
That we're going to talk about
more in detail later.

885
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,520
And that provides the basis for
our program logic in Steel.

886
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:36,040
And finally, on top of that,
on top of this program logic

887
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:39,600
we can implement dependently-typed,
verified libraries.

888
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,200
Let's have a look at how these
different components work,

889
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,640
starting with our core semantics.

890
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,600
The first step is to define
our state typeclass.

891
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:52,000
What this typeclass contains
is first the type for memory

892
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,800
and second the type for separation
logic assertions slprop.

893
01:00:55,800 --> 01:01:00,320
As well as, operators
which form a commutative monoid structure.

894
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,280
And lastly, we need to
find a way to interpret

895
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,360
the separation logic
assertion in a given memory.

896
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,160
That is, to decide whether
the separation logic assertion

897
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,640
holds or not in a given memory,
which is this intrep function.

898
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,600
Once this is done, we
can encode computations

899
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,640
as action trees parameterized
by our state typeclass.

900
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,880
These action trees are
indexed by prefix.

901
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,160
First, the written type a,

902
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,080
which is the type of values
returned by the computation.

903
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,720
Second, a precondition
pre as a slprop

904
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,200
and lastly, a postcondition post,

905
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,800
which is a separation
logic assertion

906
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,280
dependent on the value returned by the computation.

907
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,960
We can then encode
computations in a way

908
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,920
that is reminiscent of free monads.

909
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,520
First, we have two standard nodes.

910
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,040
Ret, which returns a value

911
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,040
and Act, which corresponds
to atomic actions

912
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,720
seen as computations.

913
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:55,000
We can then define composition
of the computations

914
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,560
as a node Bind.

915
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:00,240
And notice here, how
the indices of the computations

916
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,040
capture the standard rule
of separation logic.

917
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,040
The first condition q of
the first computation

918
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:09,320
actually corresponds to the precondition
of the second computation.

919
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,400
And another very
interesting thing here

920
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,440
is to look at the type of

921
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,040
this continuation of
the second computation.

922
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,560
We can see here this Dv effect,

923
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,760
which is a primitive effect
in F* for diversions.

924
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,720
What this means is that,
in this composition,

925
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:28,240
we are actually encoding
positive divergence,

926
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,680
possibly non-terminating
computations.

927
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:35,640
Lastly, we can define the node
Par for structured parallelism.

928
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:39,440
The Par role is stand out in
concurrent separation logic.

929
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,040
And observe again, how
the indices of our computations

930
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:45,120
capture this classic role.

931
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,120
Assuming that
the preconditions p and p prime,

932
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,560
offered to computations
are disjoint,

933
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:55,120
then it can safely execute with
computations in parallel.

934
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:59,120
Finally, returning the star of
the first conditions q and q prime.

935
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,800
Building upon these action trees,

936
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:05,680
we implement an intrinsically-typed
definitional interpreter

937
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:08,600
that non-deterministically
interleaves atomic actions.

938
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:13,520
This interpreter run has
the computation type NST.

939
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,080
NST corresponds to
non-deterministic stateful

940
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,640
possibly divergent computations.

941
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,440
And what's interesting here is that

942
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,080
the type of
the interpreter encapsulates

943
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,560
the soundness statement
about those semantics.

944
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:30,760
If we initially have
the validity of the precondition p

945
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,840
in our initial memory m,

946
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:37,520
then after execution, we do
have that the postcondition q

947
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,880
is valid in the final memory of m1.

948
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:43,520
And here, all this is done in
a partial-correctness setting

949
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,120
because NST can model possible
diversions computations.

950
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,920
No that we have a generic semantics,

951
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,960
we need to instantiate
a state typeclass

952
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,640
to provide a program logic.

953
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,360
The first step is to
instantiate the memory type.

954
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,000
And for this, we're going to
remain standard

955
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,800
and consider memory to be the map

956
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,280
from abstract addresses
to typed references.

957
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,920
We can then instantiate
our separation logic.

958
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,160
And the first step is to provide

959
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,760
standard separation logic connectives,

960
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,160
such as star, magic wand,
conjunction, quantification and so on.

961
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:20,360
But we're also providing
points to assertions,

962
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:23,160
which are indexed by Partial
Commutative Monoids.

963
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,200
Partial Commutative
Monoids have been

964
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,200
studied extensively in the literature,

965
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,560
and used to encode
a variety of things

966
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:32,200
such as, for instance,
sharing disciplines.

967
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,640
And lastly, they often provide
dynamically allocated invariants

968
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,280
associated to separate
logic assertions.

969
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:43,160
And that's what I will present next.

970
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,960
We'll consider named invariants,

971
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:49,320
where the name will be encoded
as a natural number.

972
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,280
And we will also have
this proposition,

973
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,960
which is here, this squiggly arrow,

974
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,760
which states that a specific name

975
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:00,600
is associated to one specific
separation logic assertion p.

976
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,760
And so it still a named invariant

977
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:07,760
is going to be association of
a name with this refinement,

978
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,400
that it's name is actually
associated to one specific

979
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,000
separation logic assertion.

980
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,640
And what's interesting here is that

981
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,560
these invariants are just values.

982
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:19,520
And as such, they are
freely duplicable

983
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,280
and they can be shared
easily between threads.

984
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:26,560
Now to dynamically allocate
invariants in Steel,

985
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,760
we provide this function
new invariant,

986
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,600
which takes as an invariant
separation logic assertion p.

987
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,680
This function has the computational
type Steel,

988
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:38,520
which reflects the computation
that we encoded as action trees.

989
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:42,040
You can see here that
the indices of the Steel effect

990
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:45,240
corresponds to the indices
of all action trees.

991
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:48,680
First index is the type
returned by the computation,

992
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,560
which is here an invariant
associated to P.

993
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:55,240
And it has a precondition that
initially we need ownership,

994
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:59,000
we need the validity of
the separation logic assertion P.

995
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
After execution of the function
and creation of invariant,

996
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,920
we do not have access to
this resource anymore,

997
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,480
it has been successfully locked
away behind the invariant.

998
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,120
Implementing this function was

999
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:11,640
one of the main technical
difficulties in Steel.

1000
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:15,920
The code is actually fairly involved
and relies on things like

1001
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,480
monotonic state.

1002
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:20,560
If you're interested, I invite
you to go read the paper.

1003
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:25,320
Now that we defined invariants in
Steel, where do we actually use them?

1004
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:29,880
The core idea of an invariant is
that it has to hold at all times.

1005
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:34,400
And because of that, only atomic
commands can access invariants

1006
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,880
as long as I restore
them after execution.

1007
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,920
So, what is atomic
commands in Steel?

1008
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:44,440
Well, first of all atomic
actions are atomic commands,

1009
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:48,160
but their possible composition
with ghost computations

1010
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,840
is also considered to be
an atomic command because

1011
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,600
these ghost computations are
computationally irrelevant,

1012
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,560
they will not be actually executed,

1013
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:59,080
and hence they can safely
be considered atomic.

1014
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:02,840
And to separate atomic computations
from regular Steel programs,

1015
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:07,320
we define a new effect SteelAtomic
as the effect of the Steel effect.

1016
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:10,040
And you can see it has many
similarities with the Steel effect.

1017
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,440
It still has original type A

1018
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,040
as well as the precondition
p and postcondition q.

1019
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:17,440
But it also has the additional
index is_ghost which indicates

1020
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,760
whether the computation
is ghost or not

1021
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,440
and allow safe composition
of atomic commands.

1022
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:26,280
It also has an additional index
that I'll omit for now.

1023
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:29,680
Now that we have this effect, we
can define an invariant handler

1024
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:33,160
which takes an argument
an invariant I associated to an slprop P

1025
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,760
and a function F.

1026
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:38,280
And what this handler says that
if F is an atomic function,

1027
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,480
which accesses p, but
stores it after execution,

1028
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,680
then you can safely open
the invariant execute F

1029
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,280
and then close the invariant again.

1030
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,960
And because of that, we
can give a signature

1031
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:52,680
that does not involve p in
specification.

1032
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:56,120
In practice, the last index
of the Steel effect I was mentioning,

1033
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:59,120
is a set of currently
open invariants

1034
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:02,400
in the sense that in
the invariants are applicable,

1035
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,320
The separation track assertions
that they protect might not be

1036
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,760
so opening an invariant
several times

1037
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,840
might actually lead to unsoundness.

1038
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:14,120
And so that's what's
SteelCore consists of.

1039
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:17,080
We provided two effects
Steel and SteelAtomic,

1040
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:19,440
which reflect
the effects of concurrency

1041
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,840
as defined by our
semantics in F*.

1042
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:26,520
And then on top of this, we
instantiated a program logic

1043
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,400
with a memory and original
separation logic

1044
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,960
containing standard connectors,

1045
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,920
as well as a PCM based
memory model and invariance.

1046
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:38,960
And we also provide a variety of
actions such as, for instance,

1047
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:43,440
an atomic compare and swap, which
allows us to operate on memory.

1048
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:48,760
Now, we can actually use this to
framework to implement verified

1049
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,480
dependently type libraries
such as, for instance,

1050
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:54,880
the library for SpinLock,
and there is no reason to stop here

1051
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,520
on top of SpinLock, we can
use the SpinLock interface

1052
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,480
to implement new libraries
such as, for instance,

1053
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,320
a library for ForkJoin operations,

1054
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,280
or a library for channel types.

1055
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,040
Channel types are a lightweight
version of session types.

1056
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,240
The idea is that to each channel,

1057
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:15,120
we're going to associate
one protocol P.

1058
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:18,680
And we're also going to provide
two separation logic assertions

1059
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:22,680
sender and receiver
to reason about these channels.

1060
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:25,120
Using the separation logic assertions,

1061
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,480
we can then specify
and implement a send function,

1062
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:32,680
which will take as arguments for
channel C associated to protocol P

1063
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:36,200
as well as message x,
which is compatible

1064
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,480
with the current
state of a protocol.

1065
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:42,200
And so what the signature of
this function states is that

1066
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:46,320
if we initially have send
permission on this channel C,

1067
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,560
and the channel is
currently as a stage where

1068
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,840
it currently needs to be executed, then
we can indeed send this message.

1069
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:56,760
And we then get a send
permission on this channel,

1070
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:01,600
where the protocol advanced
one step after executing x.

1071
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,520
And so we can define
the dual version of this,

1072
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:07,600
which would be a receive function.

1073
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,320
Using this library, we can
now specify and implement

1074
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,800
dependently type protocols
such as, for instance,

1075
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:18,040
the simple PingPong protocol.
What this protocol says is that

1076
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:22,160
we are first expected to send
an integer on a channel

1077
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:25,200
and then we're going to
receive a new integer

1078
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:28,360
which is ensured to be strictly
greater than the one we sent.

1079
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:31,480
So, this is the specification
of our protocol.

1080
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:36,000
And we can now implement
the client version of his protocol

1081
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,720
that takes as argument a channel

1082
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:40,480
which is ensured to follow
PingPong protocol.

1083
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,840
So, we first send
a message on the channel,

1084
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:49,000
which we hear p to be 17. We
then received a new integer.

1085
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,920
And since the channel is
expected to follow protocol,

1086
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,200
we can prove that this integer
is actually strictly greater

1087
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,200
than the one we sent
which here is 17.

1088
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:01,800
And what's really interesting is
that all of this verification

1089
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,880
is done here statically by
virtue of type checking.

1090
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,040
If we're for instance to start
our client implementation

1091
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,800
by trying to receive a message,

1092
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,600
verification will fail because
the protocol states that

1093
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,840
the first action has to be send.

1094
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,240
To conclude in this talk,

1095
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,400
I presented the core semantics
and prognostic of steel

1096
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,440
the shallow embedding of
concurrent separation logic in F*

1097
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,440
with dependent-typed language.

1098
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,600
A Steel Program logic has
a member model which is based

1099
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,440
on partial commutative monoids

1100
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,480
and it also enables
concurrent reasoning

1101
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:34,600
through dynamically
allocated invariants.

1102
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:37,160
All of our development
is mechanized in about

1103
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,120
11,000 lines of code in F*.

1104
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,520
And it comes with a stack
of verified libraries,

1105
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,760
which is growing every day.

1106
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,200
Our hope with the Steel framework
is to provide

1107
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,680
a full-fledged dependently
type programming language,

1108
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,400
which would be useful for verified

1109
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,240
concurrent
and distributed programming.

1110
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:55,040
All of this being built on
top of a lower memory model.

1111
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:58,280
And with an extensible program
logic which is expressed in

1112
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,720
an embedded way in F*.

1113
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:04,480
During this talk, there are many details
of our work I didn't mention.

1114
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,200
First of all our semantics
actually much more complicated

1115
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,040
to enable support for also reasoning

1116
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:12,440
in a style akin to
Implicit Dynamic Frames

1117
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,720
on top of separation logic.

1118
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,760
Second, we also allow
reasoning on references,

1119
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,920
using monotonicity and preorders.

1120
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:23,520
And lastly, we provide
several more libraries.

1121
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,880
First of all, we provide

1122
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,440
the SpinLocks and functional
libraries that I mentioned.

1123
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,760
And we also model
lock coupling lists,

1124
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,840
as well as counters with
local states using

1125
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:37,160
closures over slprop. if you're interested
by any of these things,

1126
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:42,160
I invite you to go read the paper.
Thank you for your attention.

1127
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,640
ADAM: Thanks, Aymeric.

1128
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:54,880
In either time band, you should
see a Q&A link appear in Clowdr

1129
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,760
taking you to a video
chat with at least

1130
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:00,640
one of the authors of this paper.

1131
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,680
OK, let's jump into
a talk by Mohsen Lesani.

1132
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,960
on compositional verification
of distributed systems.

1133
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,360
MOHSEN LESANI: Good morning.
I'm going to talk about TLC,

1134
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:18,880
temporal logic of distributed
components. I am Mohsen Lesani,

1135
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:23,000
an assistant professor at
the University of California Riverside.

1136
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:26,680
My student Jeremiah Griffin
that is actively working

1137
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:29,960
on the Coq framework is
present in the conference.

1138
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:34,600
The other students that helped me
are Narges Shadab and Xizhe Yin.

1139
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:39,160
Distributed systems are critical to
reliable and scalable computing.

1140
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:42,640
However, they are complicated
and prone to bugs.

1141
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:44,960
To manage this complexity,

1142
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,520
network middleware has
been traditionally built

1143
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,520
in layered stacks of components.

1144
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:54,520
The state of the art for
verification of distributed systems

1145
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:57,600
does not consider either
compositional reasoning,

1146
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,040
program logics,
or liveness properties.

1147
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:05,080
We present TLC,
a novel program logic

1148
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:07,640
for compositional
verification of both safety

1149
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:11,920
and liveness properties of
distributed system stacks.

1150
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,520
This project includes a layered and
functional programming model

1151
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:19,360
to capture distributed components,

1152
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:23,760
the temporal assertion language
to specify both safety

1153
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,080
and liveness properties.

1154
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,440
Compositional verification
of distributed stacks.

1155
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:35,400
A novel program logic that supports
intuitive reasoning steps

1156
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,240
and an operational semantics
for distributed stacks,

1157
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:42,160
and the soundness of the logic.

1158
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:45,120
We successfully applied
it to compose and verify

1159
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:48,640
stacks of fundamental
distributed components.

1160
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:52,560
The ultimate goal is to build
certified distributed middleware.

1161
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,840
And towards this goal, we are
mechanizing our proofs in Coq.

1162
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,080
We present a layered
programming model

1163
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,880
to capture functional implementations
of distributed components.

1164
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,640
The component receives incoming
requests from the parent component,

1165
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,160
and incoming indications
from the sub-components

1166
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:14,880
that defines 200 functions
request an indication

1167
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,360
for these events.

1168
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:19,960
It also defines a handler
that is periodically called.

1169
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:25,000
These handlers return a triple
the new internal state of the component

1170
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,760
and the list of issued outgoing
requests to subcomponents

1171
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,640
and outgoing indications
to the parent component.

1172
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:36,080
Let us consider the
perfect link competent,

1173
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:39,080
that uses a stubborn
link subcomponent.

1174
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:43,280
We abbreviate their
names as PL and SL.

1175
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:48,160
SL repeatedly resends messages so that
they are eventually delivered.

1176
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,640
This results in multiple deliveries.

1177
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:55,640
Therefore PL is built on the top of
SL to eliminate duplicate messages.

1178
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,320
The state of each
node stores counter

1179
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:04,360
the number of messages sent by
the current node and also received

1180
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,040
the set of received
message identifiers.

1181
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,960
Each message is uniquely identified

1182
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,440
by the pair of
the sender node identifier

1183
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:14,440
and the number of
the messages in that node.

1184
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:21,160
Upon a request to send the message
the counter is incremented

1185
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:24,840
and the message is sent together
with the new counter value

1186
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:27,840
using the SL subcomponent.

1187
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:32,080
Upon a delivery indication of
a message from the SL subcomponent,

1188
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:36,200
If the message is already
received, it is ignored.

1189
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:40,160
Otherwise, the message identifier
is added to the received set

1190
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:43,160
and appear delivery
indication event is issued.

1191
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:47,760
Here we briefly illustrate
the propagation of events across the stack.

1192
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,720
We have a stack of
components on the left

1193
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:55,280
and a trace of events on the right
with events at different levels.

1194
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:59,200
The request at the top-level
results in a request

1195
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:03,560
for the left subcomponent that
in turn results in a request

1196
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:08,280
for its own subcomponent that
results in an indication

1197
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:13,280
and another indication-up and finally
an indication at the top level.

1198
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:16,880
In the next few slides,

1199
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:20,720
we will use the indication
identifier d of an event

1200
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,440
that is the reverse
list of branch indices

1201
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,240
from the top component
to that event.

1202
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:29,760
We now take a look at parts
of the assertion language.

1203
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:33,520
We use the classical operators
always and always in the past.

1204
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,360
And eventually
and eventually in the past.

1205
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:41,840
The assertion A strong implies
A' is syntactic sugar for

1206
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,800
always A implies A'.

1207
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:49,440
The assertion A leads to
A' prime is syntactic sugar for

1208
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,760
always A implies eventually A'.

1209
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:57,760
Similarly, the assertion A preceded
by A' is syntactic sugar for

1210
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,920
always A implies eventually
in the past A'.

1211
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,440
The flexible valuables for
the elements of an event are

1212
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:09,600
the identifier n of the node
that executes the event.

1213
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:14,320
The location identifier d in
the stack that the event is executed at

1214
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:18,760
the output requests ors
an output indications

1215
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:22,640
ois that the event issues
and the prestate s

1216
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:25,840
and the post state s' of the event.

1217
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,840
We use the syntactic
sugar assertion self

1218
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:33,040
to describe events that are
applied to the top component.

1219
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,440
Now important syntactic sugar,

1220
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:39,320
here down arrow denotes
a request an up arrow denotes

1221
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,040
an indication.

1222
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:45,680
This syntactic sugar
describes an event at node n

1223
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:48,040
at the top-level location T,

1224
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:52,480
where the request event
send n' and m is executed.

1225
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:55,800
The bullet is just a separator.

1226
01:18:55,800 --> 01:19:00,800
And this second syntactic sugar
describes an event at node n

1227
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,440
at the child location one

1228
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:07,440
where the indication even
deliver n' and m is executed.

1229
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,560
This specification of both
safety and liveness properties

1230
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:14,280
of the perfect link can be
written almost verbatim

1231
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:17,440
from their natural
language descriptions.

1232
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:21,880
Let's see a reliable delivery
as a liveness property.

1233
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:27,200
If a correct node n sends
a message m to a correct node n',

1234
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:30,320
then n' will eventually deliver m

1235
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:34,480
A no-forge property
is a safety property.

1236
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:39,400
If a node n delivers
a message m with sender n'

1237
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:44,840
then n' has previously sent m to n.

1238
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:49,000
And a similar no-forge property
is stated for stubborn links,

1239
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,520
let us consider
compositional verification.

1240
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:57,520
We have two stacks S0 and S1 with
the specifications I0 and I1

1241
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:04,000
To implement a new component C
we use them as subcomponents.

1242
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,760
We want to verify
the specification A for C

1243
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:10,000
based on only the specifications

1244
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,680
and not the implementations
of the sub-components.

1245
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,960
The fundamental question is

1246
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,880
how the specification of
a component should be lowered

1247
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,800
to be used as a sub-component.

1248
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:25,000
Lowering is not possible
for every assertion.

1249
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:30,320
We observed that lowering specifications
requires certain information

1250
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:33,000
such as the location of
events to be present,

1251
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,000
and certain operators such as next to
be absent from the specification.

1252
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:43,520
We identify the subset of
the assertion language that is both

1253
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:47,000
restrictive enough to allow
the definition of the

1254
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,360
lowering transformation
and expressive enough

1255
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:53,680
to represent specifications.

1256
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:56,680
The lower function first pushes

1257
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:00,480
and then restricts the assertion.

1258
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,840
We visit each one of these
two functions in turn.

1259
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:07,920
When a component is used
as a sub-component,

1260
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,960
its events appear at a deeper level.

1261
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:14,120
For example, the location of
the events of the first component

1262
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:18,120
are at the top level
shown by the empty path.

1263
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:21,240
But then the component is used
as the first sub-component.

1264
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:26,240
The events appear at branch
zero written as the path zero.

1265
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:31,480
The push transformation pushes
the locations under branch I.

1266
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:34,200
The important case is the atom case.

1267
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:37,080
The location D is
explicit in the atom

1268
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:41,600
appending I to the location D
effectively pushes the events

1269
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,840
to branch I, next
the restrict function.

1270
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:49,200
When a stack is at the top, all
events belong to that stack.

1271
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:53,960
However, when it is pushed to
a sub stack, it's not alone anymore.

1272
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,520
It's even sorely interleaved
with the events from the

1273
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:02,000
sibling sub stacks
and the top component.

1274
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,520
The restrict transformation
restricts the specification

1275
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:10,240
to remain valid on traces that are
extended with interleaving events.

1276
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:13,480
The important case is always A.

1277
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:18,480
After pushing the session always A
does not necessarily remain valid.

1278
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:23,280
It remains valid on only
the events under that branch.

1279
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:27,640
Therefore, the restricting condition
of being under branch I is added.

1280
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:30,120
Let us take a look at a few basic

1281
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:34,160
and derived inference rules
of the TLC program logic.

1282
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:38,000
The basic inference rules capture
the fundamental reasoning steps

1283
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,920
and fit in half a page.
Yet they provide the basis

1284
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,360
for the derived rules
and verification of full stacks.

1285
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:50,760
Here we consider two basic
rules and one derived rule.

1286
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:53,560
The judgments of this form

1287
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:58,200
states that under
the assumed assertions comma

1288
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:02,920
the assertion A holds
for the component C.

1289
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:06,720
The rule OI for output
indication states that

1290
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:11,720
if at a node n an output indication
e is issued by a self event,

1291
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:17,360
then eventually at n
and the top-level T,

1292
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:21,280
the indication event e is executed.

1293
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:26,280
The rule OI' states this relation
in the opposite direction.

1294
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:30,000
If at the node n the top-level T

1295
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,200
an output indication
event e is executed,

1296
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:37,640
then in the past at that
node n the indication event e

1297
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:40,200
should have been
issued by a self event.

1298
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:44,000
Let us now look at
the derived rule INVL.

1299
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,240
This rule reduces a global temporal
invariant for the component

1300
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:53,240
to nontemporal and local proof
obligations for its handler functions.

1301
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:58,280
It states that if
a nontemporal assertion A

1302
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:02,720
holds for all the three handler
functions of the component,

1303
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:06,520
request, indication, and periodic

1304
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:10,360
then the assertion holds
in every self event.

1305
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,320
Thus the functional
implementation of the component

1306
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:18,160
can be used to derive
invariants we showcase TLC

1307
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:22,440
with the example proof of
the no-forge property for PL.

1308
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:26,200
If a PL delivery event is executed,

1309
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:29,960
it is preceded by its
corresponding PL send event.

1310
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:33,040
Starting from the Pl delivery event,

1311
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:38,040
the first step states that
if a PL delivery event is executed,

1312
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,200
the event should have
been previously issued.

1313
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:48,600
Then the step two shows that
if a PL delivery event is issued,

1314
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:52,080
it is issued by an SL deliver event.

1315
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:55,920
And step three uses the lower
specification of the no-forge

1316
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:01,400
property of the SL subcomponent.
Every SL deliver event

1317
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:04,560
is preceded by an SL send event.

1318
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:10,000
And the other steps are similar
by transitivity of precedence,

1319
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,920
we get to no-forge property for PL
these steps can be captured in TLC.

1320
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:17,840
Here we look at step two.

1321
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,880
We want to prove that if
a PL deliver event is issued,

1322
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:25,720
the issuing event is
an SL deliver event.

1323
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:30,320
To prove it, we use the rule
INVL that we saw before

1324
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:33,680
with this assertion
A that states that

1325
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:38,680
the PL deliver event is issued
by only an SL delivery

1326
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:43,200
and the definition of the component SC.

1327
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:47,000
The first obligation is
for the request handler.

1328
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:52,000
The request function issues
an empty set of output indications

1329
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:58,400
and so the assertion
A trivially halts.

1330
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:02,760
The next obligation is for
the indication handler.

1331
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:05,840
It issues the PL deliver event,

1332
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:09,640
but that is when an SL
deliver event is processed.

1333
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:12,480
So, the assertion A halts.

1334
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,480
And finally the obligation
for the periodic handler

1335
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:19,240
trivially halts in this component.

1336
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:22,800
This results in this assertion.

1337
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,240
That is a simple rearrangement

1338
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:26,320
is equivalent to
the assertion in step two.

1339
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:30,000
We define the operational
semantics of distributed stacks.

1340
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,240
It models the propagation
of events across the stack

1341
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:36,840
message passing actress nodes in
partially synchronous networks

1342
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:40,200
and crash stop failures.

1343
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,560
We prove the soundness of TLC.

1344
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:46,960
TLC derives only valid assumptions
from valid assumptions.

1345
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,480
We also proved
the soundness of lowering,

1346
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:53,840
if an invariant is
valid for a stack Si

1347
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,880
and Si is a sub stack
of a stack S,

1348
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:02,480
then the lowered invariant
is valid for S as well.

1349
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,080
We successfully
applied this approach

1350
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:09,400
to stack of fundamental
distributed components including

1351
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:13,160
stubborn links, perfect
links, best-effort broadcast,

1352
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:18,280
uniform reliable broadcast
and epoch Paxos consensus.

1353
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:20,960
And towards the goal of
certified middleware,

1354
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,680
we are mechanizing our
proofs in a Coq framework.

1355
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:26,000
I invite you to read the paper

1356
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,160
and I will be glad to
answer your questions.

1357
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,560
ADAM: Thanks, Mohsen.
In either time band,

1358
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,680
you should now see
a link appearing Clowdr

1359
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:44,440
to join the video Q&A
with Mohsen.

1360
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,720
To close out the session
we have Ningning Xie,

1361
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,760
presenting a variant
of algebraic effects

1362
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,640
that admits efficient
implementation.

1363
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,840
NINGNING XIE: Hello
everyone, I'm Ningning.

1364
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:15,720
I'm going to present our work
effect handlers evidently.

1365
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:19,280
Hello, in this work we show that

1366
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:22,760
we can elaborate algebraic
effects the evidence passing

1367
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,760
to polymorphic lambda calculus.

1368
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:28,200
This gives new semantics
of algebraic effects.

1369
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:32,000
In particular, there is no need
for a special runtime system

1370
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,840
for implementations. This
can be extremely useful

1371
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:40,520
if you want to compile algebraic
effects to languages like C.

1372
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:43,400
Moreover, we show that
with evidence passing

1373
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:46,520
such implementations
can be quite efficient.

1374
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,560
Before we go to
the technical details

1375
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:53,360
let's start with an overview
of algebraic effects.

1376
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:56,720
Algebraic effects and an
extension with handlers

1377
01:28:56,720 --> 01:29:00,800
are a powerful way to incorporate
effects in programming languages.

1378
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,360
To understand how it works,

1379
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:06,160
we start with a simple
example of the reader effect.

1380
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:09,880
On the left-hand side, we
define a simple effect reader,

1381
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:14,720
which has a single operation
ask. The type of ask says that

1382
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:17,680
you can ask by providing
a unit argument,

1383
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:20,160
then you'll there
return you an integer.

1384
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:22,960
Now we can already start using ask.

1385
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:27,480
The expressions below simply could
ask twice and returns the sum.

1386
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:31,080
However, we still don't know
how it would evaluate.

1387
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:34,560
The semantics of effects is
given by effect handlers,

1388
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,120
where handlers provide
operation implementations.

1389
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:42,600
we handle an expression by replicating a
lambda which takes a unit.

1390
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:46,960
in our example, we use x to
denote the operation argument.

1391
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:51,760
In this case unit. The extra
argument k is implicitly provided

1392
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:55,000
by the system, which
denotes the resumption,

1393
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,720
that is how to resume the computation
where operation is performed.

1394
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:02,840
In this case, we always
redeem with one.

1395
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:06,320
When the first ask is performed,
the handler returns one

1396
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:09,560
and we have one plus
perform as unit.

1397
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:13,400
Then the second ask is
performed and we have 1+1

1398
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:15,800
which gives a result two.

1399
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:18,400
One remarkable feature
of algebraic effects

1400
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:22,560
is a decoupling of effects and is
the implementation of effects.

1401
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,040
In particular, we can
use the same handler

1402
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,680
to handle a different computation or

1403
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:32,680
we can easily use a different handler
to handle the same computation.

1404
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,200
In summary, algebraic effects
provide a useful way to encode

1405
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:42,520
composable and modular computational
effects by having effects,

1406
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:46,640
which define a family of operations
separately for handlers,

1407
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:49,000
which gives semantics to operations.

1408
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,560
We have seen that example of reader

1409
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:55,760
and refer to our paper for
more complicated examples.

1410
01:30:56,440 --> 01:31:00,560
However, it is non-trivial to
support algebraic effects

1411
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:02,960
in real world programming languages,

1412
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:06,280
we demonstrate
the issue with this example.

1413
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:10,400
This code has three handlers,
followed by an expression,

1414
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:14,400
which simply could ask twice
as we have seen before.

1415
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:18,360
The three handlers are a reader
handler, an Incr handler,

1416
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:21,160
which increases
the computation results by one,

1417
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:25,400
and an exception handler, which
returns a default value three

1418
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,520
if the computation fails.

1419
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:31,000
As before, since the reader
always returns one,

1420
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,720
we expect the answer to be two.

1421
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:38,720
Now let's take a closer look at
how this expression evaluates.

1422
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:42,240
We first evaluate
the reader handler.

1423
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:44,200
Now we need to remember that

1424
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:46,000
we have a reader handler
available in the

1425
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:50,560
evaluation context,
since there, we may need to use

1426
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:53,080
the handler to handle
certain operations.

1427
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:56,840
In a similar way, we
evaluate the incr handler,

1428
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:00,400
and then the exception handler.

1429
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:05,280
We then hit the first ask,
but we don't know how to handle it,

1430
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:09,120
thus, we yield up to
the evaluation context,

1431
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:12,040
and hope to find a reader handle.

1432
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:14,960
So inner most handler
is exception handler,

1433
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:17,640
which is not useful in this case,

1434
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:21,120
we keep going up
and find an incr handler,

1435
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:24,920
which is again not
useful in this case.

1436
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:29,000
Finally, we reach a reader
handler, which states that,

1437
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,000
we should always resume
with integer one.

1438
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:36,160
Now we need to resume and go
back where the operation

1439
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:41,040
is handled, and this is
where we hit the second ask.

1440
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:44,560
Now we need to repeat
the whole process again

1441
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,880
by first yielding up
and then resuming.

1442
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:52,720
As you may have noticed, implementing
algebraic affects this way

1443
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:55,400
requires special runtime
support to yield up,

1444
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:59,240
to capture the resumption
and to resume.

1445
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:03,240
This is very difficult to add to
existing programming languages,

1446
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:07,280
moreover, it is very inefficient.

1447
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:12,000
To support two asks, we have
yield up, and resumed twice,

1448
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,400
and it can be more time
consuming if the handler stack

1449
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:17,920
is even larger.

1450
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:21,760
Hence, the goal of our work
is to have composable,

1451
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:27,200
modular, efficient, and easy to
implement computational effects.

1452
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:31,360
To this end, we present new
semantics of algebraic effects

1453
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:34,560
in terms of polymorphic
lambda calculus,

1454
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:39,120
by first introducing
an intermediate evidence calculus.

1455
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:42,400
We can then elaborate
polymorphic algebraic effects,

1456
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:47,000
there are evidence passing
translation to the evidence calculus.

1457
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,080
This turns out to be surprisingly
tricky to get right.

1458
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:56,080
In particular, the coherence
of evidence translation

1459
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:59,440
turns out to only be preserved
under scoped resumptions.

1460
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:03,200
Finally, we define a monadic
multi prompt translation

1461
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:08,080
for the evidence calculus to
the polymorphic lambda calculus.

1462
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:12,520
Combining these two translations,
we get an implementation

1463
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:15,880
of algebraic effects upon
polymorphic lambda calculus,

1464
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:19,080
and that requires no
special runtime support.

1465
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:23,520
We have proved soundness
and completeness of the translation.

1466
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:27,280
They also turn out that
doing this translation

1467
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:30,720
does not only get rid of
special runtime system,

1468
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:35,480
but also allows us to implement
algebraic effects more efficiently,

1469
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:39,200
especially for
resumptive operations.

1470
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:41,960
In the rest of the talk, we
first go through the meaning

1471
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:46,960
of the scoped resumptions, and then
discuss these two translations.

1472
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:52,120
To understand the restriction
of scoped resumptions,

1473
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:54,080
let's consider this example.

1474
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:57,440
Here, we have two
handlers, h1 and hevil,

1475
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:00,480
that bracket the expression E.

1476
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:04,040
The whole result is then given to F.

1477
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:08,840
The definition of E performs three
operations, ask, evil, and ask.

1478
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:13,200
The handler h1 is a reader
handler which handles ask

1479
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:15,520
by always resuming with one.

1480
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:20,160
A real expectation now in
that these two asks in e

1481
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:22,240
with the return one.

1482
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:27,520
However, we show that while
the first ask as expected

1483
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:32,360
gives back one, the second ask
gives back a different number two.

1484
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:35,120
How is that possible?

1485
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:36,960
We define the evil
handler in a way that

1486
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:42,360
instead of resuming, it directly
returns the resumption K.

1487
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:46,760
F then gets the resumption,
and applies the resumption

1488
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:49,680
under a different handler
h2, which handles ask

1489
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:52,480
by returning two instead.

1490
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:56,720
Note in this example, K is
captured under a handler

1491
01:35:56,720 --> 01:36:01,720
context with h1, and is resumed
under a different handler with h2,

1492
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:04,960
this is very powerful,
perhaps too powerful

1493
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:09,800
that it can interfere with ability
to reason about the program.

1494
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:15,240
We define the notion of scoped
resumptions as a restriction

1495
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:18,520
of general effect handlers, where
resumptions can only be applied

1496
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:22,200
in the very scope of their
original handler context.

1497
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:25,600
Thus, the previous example is
rejected under scoped assumptions.

1498
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:29,120
We believe that all
important effected handlers

1499
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:31,440
can be written with
scoped assumptions

1500
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:34,840
including complicated
examples like async

1501
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:36,800
or concurrent scheduling.

1502
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:40,560
The previous example can also be
re-written to pass the restriction.

1503
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:43,360
In this work, we focus on
the evidence translation

1504
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:46,040
and use a dynamic check
in our formalism.

1505
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:48,600
In the paper, we also
show several designs

1506
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:52,760
on how to check this properly.

1507
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:56,640
Using scoped resumptions, we define
the evidence passing translation.

1508
01:36:56,640 --> 01:37:01,640
The key idea of evidence
passing is that,

1509
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:05,160
a vector of handlers is passed
down as an implicit parameter

1510
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:08,600
similar to
the dictionary translation,

1511
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:11,800
in Haskell for type classes.

1512
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:14,360
To understand how
evidence passing works,

1513
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:17,160
we re-evaluate the previous example

1514
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:20,040
using the evidence
passing semantics.

1515
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:23,840
As before, we first evaluate
the reader handler.

1516
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:27,520
This time, we create
a fresh unique marker

1517
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:32,360
represented as m1 to denote this
particular reader handler,

1518
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:35,560
we code the pair of
the marker and the handler

1519
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:40,400
and evidence, and we pass
the evidence down as we evaluate.

1520
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:45,600
We then evaluate the incr handler
by creating another fresh

1521
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,120
unique marker m2
and pass the new evidence

1522
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:51,240
along with the existing
reader evidence, that is,

1523
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:54,160
we now have an evidence vector.

1524
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:57,800
We denote our evidence
vector using the letter w.

1525
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:00,800
We do the same for
the exception handler,

1526
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:03,520
and get one more evidence.

1527
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:05,760
Now we hit the first ask operation,

1528
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:09,680
this time, we first inspect
the evidence vector.

1529
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:13,440
From the evidence vector,
we find the reader handler

1530
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:18,200
that is supposed to handle
this operation has marker m1,

1531
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:21,320
we can then yield up,
but in this case,

1532
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:25,080
finding the correct handler
can be much faster than before

1533
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:28,920
because we only needed
to compare the markers.

1534
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:33,200
Actually, the evaluation can
be even faster, that is,

1535
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:36,080
we don't need to yield up at all.

1536
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:39,520
Because from the evidence
vector, we do not only know

1537
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:44,200
the marker of the handler, but we
have the handler itself available.

1538
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:47,480
From the handler
implementation, we know that

1539
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:51,120
the reader handler has a tail
resumptive implementation,

1540
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:54,640
therefore, we can evaluate
the handler in place

1541
01:38:54,640 --> 01:39:01,160
and get a result one, as the result
of ask, and keep evaluating.

1542
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:05,240
We can then hit the second
ask and get the other one.

1543
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:08,360
Compared to the previous evaluation,

1544
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:11,040
this time, the evaluation
is a straight line,

1545
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:14,880
which means that it does not
change the control flow at all,

1546
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:18,880
this is just much more efficient
than the previous one.

1547
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:22,120
To make such evaluation
strategies possible,

1548
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:24,600
we have proved
the following theorem.

1549
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,880
The theorem essentially states that,

1550
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:29,560
while performing
an operation of effect L,

1551
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:32,720
the handler we find in
the evidence vector w

1552
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:36,800
which is w, l is exactly
the innermost handler

1553
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:41,440
for that operation in the dynamic
evaluation context, which is mh.

1554
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:45,600
Thus, with evidence processing,
we significantly improve

1555
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:48,720
the efficiency of algebraic effects.

1556
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:52,920
In particular, tail resumption
operations can evaluate in place.

1557
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:56,440
This optimization enables
efficient effect operations

1558
01:39:56,440 --> 01:40:01,080
at a cost similar to
a virtual method call.

1559
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:04,800
Non tail-resumptive operations
still needed to yield up,

1560
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:07,440
but from the evidence vector,
we can locally decide

1561
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:10,440
which marker to yield to,
which is still more efficient

1562
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:13,080
than finding
the handler dynamically.

1563
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:17,360
Hello everyone.

1564
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:20,080
Next at this passing, we
can then implement handlers

1565
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:22,960
using multi-prompt continuations.

1566
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:26,960
So basically, given evidence
mh, we can directly yield

1567
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:31,920
to a specific prompt n, moreover,
since the evidence provided

1568
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:35,280
the handler implementation
directly, it is no longer needed

1569
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,840
in the context.

1570
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:41,440
Such translation is very important
and it provides the missing link

1571
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:44,800
between traditional implementation
based on dynamic search

1572
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:48,480
for the handlers,
and implementations of lexical effect handlers

1573
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:52,240
using multi prompt
delimited control.

1574
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:55,440
Specifically, we define
a multi prompt translation

1575
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:59,960
from the evidence language into
standard polymorphic lambda calculus

1576
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:04,120
where the monad implements
the multi prompt semantics.

1577
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:07,520
Now, no special runtime
system is needed anymore,

1578
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:10,640
and we can generate code
directly for languages

1579
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:12,760
like C or Web Assembly.

1580
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:15,520
Moreover, with our
standard back end,

1581
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:19,160
advanced compilation structures
can be used for example,

1582
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,400
compilation guided,
reference counting.

1583
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:23,760
Hello everyone.

1584
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:30,280
We summarize all calculi in
our paper using this figure.

1585
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:34,640
We have a polymorphic algebraic
effect calculus system at e,

1586
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:37,080
we can erase the types
in system at e,

1587
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:41,800
and gets to an untyped algebraic
effect calculus, system lambda e.

1588
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:44,720
Also, we can do an evidence
passing translation

1589
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:48,880
to a polymorphic evidence
calculus, system at ev.

1590
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:51,760
Finally, we show that
system at ev can use

1591
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:54,960
the multi-prompts translation
and translate it to a polymorphic

1592
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,360
lambda calculus, system fv.

1593
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:00,680
With both translations available,
we get an implementation

1594
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:04,240
of polymorphic algebraic
effects in terms of polymorphic

1595
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:06,120
lambda calculus.

1596
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:08,400
Hello everyone.

1597
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:10,360
Please read our paper
for more details,

1598
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:13,760
moreover, we have provided
an implementation

1599
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,640
of the evidence passing translation

1600
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:17,600
in the Koka programming language.

1601
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,440
And initial benchmark
results are very promising.

1602
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:24,720
Finally, we present a Haskell
library of effect handlers

1603
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:27,280
based on the technique
described here,

1604
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:30,960
but we encourage interested
people to read our Haskell paper

1605
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:33,000
or watch the talk for more details.
