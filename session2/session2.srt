00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,640


2
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560


3
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,280


4
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,800


5
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,640


6
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,920


7
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,960
ALAN JEFFREY: Hello everybody.

8
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,920
And welcome to the second
session of ICFP 2020.

9
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,800
You're joining us on YouTube,

10
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,400
and registered participants
for the conference

11
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,840
can also join us in chat,

12
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,280
on the Clowdr system.

13
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,160
And also, if they want
to join a live Q&A,

14
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,520
with the authors, after the talk.

15
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,600
And so the first talk
for the session,

16
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,360
is going to be achieving high
performance thre fuctional way,

17
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,920
and it'll be presented by,

18
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,160
Bastian Hagedorn.

19
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,560
BASTIAN: Hi, this Bastian Hagedorn,

20
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,320
from the university of Münster,

21
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,400
and I'll be presenting
a functional pearl,

22
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,880
on achieving high-perfomance,

23
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,640
the functional way.

24
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,400
This one's about expressing
high-performance

25
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,720
program optimizations,
as rewrite strategies.

26
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,880
This is joint work with colleagues
from the universities of Edinburgh

27
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
and Glasgow.

28
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,400
Let me begin with
asking the question,

29
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,560
why we care about high
performance in the first place?

30
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,120
And the answer is quite simple,

31
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,720
We literally cannot afford not to.

32
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,680
Because apparently it cost
about a quarter million dollars

33
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,120
to perform state of the art
machine learning research.

34
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,640
And this high cost is mostly due to

35
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,520
the long time required to train neural
networks on parallel hardware.

36
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,640
It gets worse when you translate
the dollar spent into carbon emitted.

37
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,120
So here, training
this neural network,

38
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,120
releases about five tons of carbon

39
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
into the atmosphere,

40
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,000
which is equivalent to driving
11,000 miles with a car.

41
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,440
And just to show you
how insane it is,

42
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,280
here's a map showing a road trip,

43
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,840
from the North of Norway,

44
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,960
all the way down to South Africa.

45
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,560
Which corresponds to
roughly 11,000 miles.

46
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,520
So clearly, we need to find a way,

47
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,680
to reduce those costs,

48
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,560
and optimizing a program, to
achieve high performance.

49
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,320
Might allow us to significantly
reduce the time required to,

50
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
to, for example,

51
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,640
train neural networks.

52
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,320
So, how do we achieve
high perfomance?

53
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,520
Here's a naive implementation

54
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,600
of a matrix multiplication
and computation in CUDA,

55
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,640
which targets GPU's.

56
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,120
And if you know, a little
bit about CUDA and GPU's,

57
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,120
I'd argue that,

58
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,000
this is quite easy to
write and to understand.

59
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,560
But unfortunately, this
program is also not very fast.

60
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,800
So, for achieving the highest
performance on modern GPU's,

61
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,680
the simple program has to
be significantly modified.

62
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,040
So for example, here is
an optimized version,

63
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,840
of the same computation,

64
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,680
which achieves up to three orders
of magnitude more performance.

65
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,360
And if we compare this again
to our road trip example,

66
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,520
and the carbon emitted,

67
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,920
a thousand X improvement

68
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,000
barely allows us to drive
15 minutes on the highway.

69
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,160
However, this manual way of
achieving high performance,

70
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,880
requires some expert to sit down,

71
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,880
for quite some time,
and to optimize the program,

72
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,840
in a time intensive
and incredibly error prone process.

73
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,440
So, another way,

74
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,800
to achieve high performance,

75
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,520
is what I call the decoupled way,

76
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,560
which was pioneered by the domain
specific compiler called Halide.

77
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,840
And the key idea here,

78
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,520
is to decouple what
is being computed,

79
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,840
from how it is optimized.

80
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,120
So this allows a domain scientist,

81
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,360
to focus on implementing
the computation,

82
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,520
which can then be
separately optimized,

83
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,160
by a performance engineer,

84
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,200
with the so called schedule.

85
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,960
And this way of achieving
high performance,

86
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,440
is currently very popular,

87
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,840
there're many compilers
following this approach.

88
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,320
So, this particular example here,

89
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,040
is taken from the TVM
machine learning compiler,

90
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,680
which is currently
the state of the art,

91
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,800
in generating high performance
machine learning implementation.

92
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,600
TVM comes with a tutorial

93
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,200
on how to optimize matrix
modifications for CPU's.

94
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,520
And we'll take a closer
look at that in a moment.

95
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,680
So the TVM compiler uses both
the algorithm and the schedule,

96
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,920
to generate an efficient
implementation.

97
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,520
So here, for example, we
see the blocking version

98
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,880
from the TVM tutorial,

99
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,320
which applies some specific
group transformations.

100
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
The best version presented
in this tutorial,

101
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,840
is about 200 times faster
than the baseline,

102
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,640
but only requires to add a few
more lines to the schedule,

103
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,680
or at least that's the idea.

104
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,720
So when you take
a closer look at this,

105
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,320
the schedule based approach,

106
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,240
you'll find a few problems.

107
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,640
One of the first few
things you might find is that

108
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,000
the algorithm and
the schedule are not fully separated.

109
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,040
Here, the schedule uses
the same path in identifier,

110
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,120
that has been declared
in the algorithm.

111
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,400
And that simply means that,

112
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,120
both the algorithm and the schedule

113
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,920
have to live in the same scope,

114
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,400
and that hinders
the re-use of the schedule,

115
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,880
for optimizing
a different computation.

116
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,680
The next problem is that there's
no well-defined semantics,

117
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,640
for the scheduling preemptives.

118
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,480
So there's only
a documentation online,

119
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,920
And for some primitives,

120
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,960
this is quite cryptic
and basically requires,

121
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,600
knowledge of how the compiler
internally implements

122
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,680
the scheduling primitives.

123
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,040
And finally, all scheduling
primitives are built in,

124
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,320
which makes them hard to extend.

125
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,840
So typically every  primitive,

126
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,240
like tile or vectorize,

127
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,960
represents a common
optimization,

128
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,720
you might want to apply,

129
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,880
but as soon as you need
something slightly different

130
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
you're in trouble.

131
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,160
Because, there's no easy way to extend
the set of exposed optimizations

132
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,480
besides digging deep into
the implementation of the compiler itself.

133
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,320
And this is something we
don't often want to do.

134
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,200
So, this is why with our
functional approach,

135
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,720
we aim for a more principled way,

136
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,040
to describe and apply high-performance
program optimizations.

137
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,720
Specifically, we aim
to separate concerns, by

138
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,280
specifying computation at
a high obstruction level only,

139
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,840
without changing them for
expressing optimizations.

140
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,160
We aim to facilitate reuse by
defining optimization strategies,

141
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,280
clearly separated from
the computations.

142
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,000
We aim to enable composability
by allowing to define both

143
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,920
computations and optimizations
as compositions of

144
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,680
user defined building blocks.
We aim to allow reasoning by

145
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,280
giving those building blocks
well-defined semantics.

146
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,720
And finally, we aim to be
explicit and avoid all implicit

147
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,600
default behavior of the compiler.

148
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,520
And essentially we argue that
a strategy language should

149
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,840
be built with the same
standards as a language

150
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,400
describing the computation. Now,
let me show you the functional,

151
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,880
way of achieving
high performance.

152
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,160
In our approach we follow
the same idea of decoupling

153
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,200
computations and optimizations,
but we're using the well established

154
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,760
functional programming
techniques to express both.

155
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,360
So on the top left, we have a high
level program that is written in

156
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,200
the function programming
language called rise.

157
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,760
That is based on
the ICFP paper from 2015.

158
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,520
And on the right, you see
an optimization strategy that describes

159
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,440
how to optimize that rise program.
And this is written in elevate,

160
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,080
which is based on ideas already
published in the late nineties.

161
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,800
Our compiler then rewrites
the rise program based on the

162
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,560
optimizations described in
the elevate strategy and

163
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,440
eventually generates
high performance code.

164
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,880
Our functional pearl is all
about how to express the high

165
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,000
performance optimizations
typically applied manually or

166
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,280
using the schedule based approach.

167
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,880
However, as composable
rewrites strategies instead.

168
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,520
Alright, let's see how we do
this and we'll start by taking

169
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,640
a closer look at
elevate our language

170
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,280
for describing the optimizations.

171
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,480
The most basic building block
in elevate is a strategy and

172
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,440
a strategy is simply a function
from some program P to what

173
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,800
we call a rewrite result and
a rewrite result is simply saying

174
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,440
whether the applied strategy
succeeded in which case it contains

175
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,840
the rewritten program,
or it failed in which case it

176
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,320
contained the strategy,
which failed.

177
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,320
Rewrite rules are examples
for very simple strategies.

178
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,520
And you could, for example,
go ahead and implement

179
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,040
the typical fusion rule for rise
programs as an elevate strategy.

180
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,480
As you see on the bottom. This
rule simply says that whenever

181
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,480
you see a rise program that
contains two consecutive maps,

182
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,480
you can fuse those maps
and return the fused program,

183
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,760
and if there are no
consecutive two maps,

184
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,960
then this rule is simply not
applicable and it fails.

185
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,720
For building more powerful strategies,
we can combine tools

186
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,480
and elevate using several
different combinators.

187
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,600
So for example,
the sequence combinator allows

188
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,160
to apply two strategies in sequence.

189
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,200
The left choice operator
expects also two strategies,

190
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,520
but only applies the second one
in case the first one fails.

191
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,520
The try combinator tries to
apply the given strategy and

192
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,840
if it is not applicable, it's
simply returns the unchanged

193
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,800
input program by applying
the ID strategy.

194
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,160
And finally, the repeat strategy
allows us to repetitively apply

195
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,240
the same strategy until it
is no longer applicable.

196
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,880
Now, what if we have
the following situation.

197
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,120
Here you see a rise program
that contains three maps.

198
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,600
And if we now want to apply
the mapfusion rule, we have just defined,

199
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,520
there are two possible
locations for fusing the maps.

200
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,880
So we can either use the first
two or the last two maps.

201
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,120
And with elevate, you can
precisely define locations in

202
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,920
the AST using so-called traverses.

203
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,320
So for example, the body traversal
applies a given strategy at

204
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,440
the body of a function
abstruction mode.

205
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,760
And in this example, body
mapfusion would then fuse the

206
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,160
first two maps as we've seen here.

207
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,480
Similarly, we define traversals
for the other nodes and

208
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,800
could for example, apply
for the argument of fusion,

209
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,440
for fusing the last thing that's in
this expression and in the paper,

210
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,320
we explained in more detail how
to describe precise locations

211
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,960
using these and other traverses.

212
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,760
Sometimes it's not desirable
to specify a precise path,

213
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,840
but instead we might want to
say something like apply this

214
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,320
given strategy at
the first place you'll find,

215
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,920
and this is what bottom
up or top down do.

216
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,240
So these traverses strategies,
traverse AST either like from top

217
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,240
down or bottom up
and apply the given strategy

218
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,680
at the first place where it's
applicable and then stop.

219
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,560
Another useful traversal is
the normalized strategy,

220
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,600
which applies a given strategy
exhaustively until it is no longer

221
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,280
applicable anywhere in
the give expression.

222
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,800
And in the paper we define a few
normal forms for rise expression.

223
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,440
And one simple example
for one of those is

224
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,680
the beta eta-normal form, which
simply applies beta reduction

225
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,600
and eta reduction
as often as possible.

226
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,280
Using those generic building
blocks, we then try to implement

227
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,640
TVM scheduling language
and try to especially define

228
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,640
elevate strategies that
apply the same optimizations

229
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,760
as describing the TVM tutorial,
which we've mentioned earlier.

230
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,600
So here's what the baseline
version looks like.

231
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,800
And for TVM, we described
the matrix multiplication using

232
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,880
the pipe and API and use
the default schedule

233
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,360
to generate unoptimized code.

234
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,880
For our functional way, we describe
the matrix multiplication

235
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,000
computation using rise
and its functional array

236
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,760
primitives like
map and reduce.

237
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,840
And we define a separate
strategy in elevate,

238
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,560
which explained how to
optimize this computation.

239
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,640
And here we can already see that
we have a clear separation

240
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,200
between the computation
and the optimization.

241
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,360
More crucially TVM's default
strategy implicitly describes

242
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,480
some way of lowering
the program to execute the code.

243
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,600
And we don't really know
how this is performed.

244
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,280
With our approach, we aim to
completely avoid implicit behavior

245
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,240
and describe every
transformation explicitly.

246
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,120
So here, we're simply saying
that the dot product should

247
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,160
be computed using a single
statement, by fusing the map and

248
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,320
the reduce pattern, similar to
how TVM computes the dot product.

249
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,440
This way we implemented each of the

250
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,360
seven differently optimized versions.

251
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,400
And in the paper we described,
for example, how to implement

252
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,560
TVMs built-in tile
optimization as a composition

253
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,360
of only a few rewrite rules
and the combinators and

254
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,360
traversals we've just seen.
Also our functional approach

255
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,600
allows us to define
the different optimized versions

256
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,880
as reusable strategies.
So here, for example,

257
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,880
we define the loop perms strategy,

258
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,000
which we will reuse in
the following more optimized versions.

259
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,400
This is the most optimized
version implemented

260
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,320
in both TVM and our approach.

261
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,320
And here you can see that
we are able to reuse and

262
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,440
to build upon
the loop perm strategy,

263
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,920
whereas in TVM we always have to
describe the whole optimization

264
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,880
from scratch because we cannot
easily define our own abstruction.

265
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,680
One crucial problem is also that
the TVM algorithm has to be

266
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,200
changed a few times during
the tutorial because the scheduling

267
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,920
language is not powerful enough

268
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,520
to express all desirable
optimizations.

269
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,320
Our approach with rise and elevate
does not require us to do so.

270
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,120
And we use the same rise matrix
multiplication that is optimized

271
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,640
by seven different
and separate elevate strategies.

272
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,200
To evaluate our approach,
we look at two things.

273
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,920
So first in the first experiment,
we simply counted the number of

274
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,240
successful rewrite steps for
versions, which you can see here.

275
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,800
And since the baseline version
does not perform any interesting

276
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,280
transformations it only
requires a few rewrite steps.

277
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,800
But as soon as we're performing
actual program optimizations,

278
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,440
we reach about yeah,
45 thousands and

279
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,400
later up to 62,000
separate rewrites steps.

280
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,240
And this shows that our
approach is scalable because

281
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,120
we were able to define
the complex TVM like optimizations

282
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,560
by simply composing a few
rewrite rules using elevate.

283
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,280
Also performing this many steps
took less than two seconds

284
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,040
per version on a regular notebook.
So this is no bottleneck.

285
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,680
Obviously we also wanted to see
if the performance we achieve

286
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,600
with our functional way
matches the performance

287
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,840
achieved by the TVM compiler.
And here you see the performance

288
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,880
achieved for each of
the seven different versions and

289
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,120
you'll find that we are able
to achieve a similar trend,

290
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,520
which means that our
elevate strategies encode

291
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,680
the same high performance
program optimizations as applied

292
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,280
by the state of
the art TVM compiler.

293
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,880
And if you would like to find out
more about a functional way of

294
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,280
achieving high performance,
simply contact us and

295
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,680
have a look at our
paper and with this,

296
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,120
I'd like to end the presentation.

297
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,480
I mentioned that you can find
all our implementations

298
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,280
online or in the artifacts.
Thanks for your attention.

299
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:18,680
(CLAPS)
ALAN JEFFREY: So thank you, Bastian.

300
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:24,560
So for anybody who is wanting to join
the authors for the live Q&A,

301
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,640
you can click on the link that's
in the Clowdr page for this talk.

302
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,280
Our next paper in the second
session of ICFP 2020,

303
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,120
is going to be Staged selective
parser combinators and

304
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,680
it's going to be presented by
Jamie Willis and Nick Wu.

305
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,520
JAMIE: Hello? Can you hear me?
NICK: Hello? Yeah, I can hear you.

306
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,160
JAMIE: Nice. I can hear you too.
NICK: So I don't know if we've met.

307
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,480
My name is Nick Wu. I'm from
Imperial college London.

308
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,040
JAMIE: Oh, Hey, I'm Jamie
Willis. I'm also from Imperial.

309
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,080
NICK: Oh, what a coincidence.
It's strange doing an

310
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,080
online conference with
prerecord videos. Isn't it?

311
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,080
JAMIE: Yeah. ICFP is
interesting this year.

312
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,440
I wonder if anyone's made the most
of it in their presentation somehow.

313
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,040
NICK: Indeed. So what
are you working on?

314
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,760
JAMIE: I've been
working with parsers.

315
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,200
NICK: Oh, nice. I'm a big
fan of parser combinators.

316
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,840
JAMIE: What are those?
NICK: Oh, well, they're a way of building

317
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,320
a parse that follows
the structure of a grammar closely

318
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,160
by treating parses as first
class values and building

319
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,360
larger parsers from smaller ones.

320
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,280
JAMIE: Right. Can I have an example?

321
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,120
NICK: Let's look at the BNF for
a language that recognizes

322
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,880
strings of characters. Let's
suppose that they're non-empty.

323
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,240
So here's some code the non
terminal alpha is the choice of

324
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,120
letters from A to Z and alphas
consists of what of those followed

325
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,440
either by more alphas or by
absent on the empty token.

326
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,720
JAMIE: Okay. So how'd you
actually write the parsers then.

327
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,720
NICK: Right? And so in Haskell
alpha is a value

328
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,560
of type parser char since
it pauses a character.

329
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,600
And here we simply give
the alternative between each of the chars.

330
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,560
The alphas parser returns a list of
chars by first parsing an alpha,

331
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,400
and then appending it to the results

332
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,760
of more alphas
or just the empty list.

333
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,320
JAMIE: Right. So how does that
strange cons thing work?

334
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,800
NICK: Okay. So parsers are afflictive
so we can lift normal functions

335
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,160
and constructors like cons
so that they can work on parsers.

336
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,280
So here the pure cons
just makes the function

337
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,360
work at the parser level. And then
the app, which is the star will

338
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,200
ensure that Px is parsed
first followed by Pxs.

339
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,640
And then it's put
together with cons.

340
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,720
JAMIE: That doesn't seem like
something you can execute.

341
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,800
NICK: Well, if you want to
actually run one of these parsers

342
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:14,120
on an input string Xs, then you
use the run parser function that

343
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,480
will take the string and return
the parse result if it can.

344
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,240
JAMIE: Right. So those combinators
seem really verbose

345
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,320
I usually just use EBNF like this,
where you'd use a character class

346
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,680
and a plus, and it gets
rid of a lot of the bloat.

347
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,520
NICK: Yeah, sure. That makes
sense. Well, you can also do

348
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,760
this with combinators as well.
Here's what you do with alphas.

349
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,400
We're using one of which will
take one of the A to Z in

350
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,200
the ranges you've done. And the plus

351
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,440
says that you simply
want some of those.

352
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,920
JAMIE: Ah, that's neat. Okay. So
how are oneOf and some implemented?

353
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,440
NICK: Well, there also in terms of
simple Combinators oneOf is,

354
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,600
in terms of the primitive satisfy
and satisfy takes a primitive,

355
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,120
takes a predicate and accepts
an input character that satisfies it.

356
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,040
For oneOf we simply want it to be
an element of a given list Cs.

357
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,040
Some can actually be
implemented in terms of

358
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,320
what we've seen
so far. Can you see how?

359
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,440
JAMIE: Sure. Let me see. I think
if I took the alphas example,

360
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,760
I could reverse engineer it. So
I guess if I factor this alpha out

361
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,520
then that would give me some,

362
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,800
so I'd replace alphas and PX
and then alphas with some PX.

363
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,560
NICK: Yeah, that's right. And
you could furthermore factor out

364
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,920
what's inside
the brackets to have both an

365
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,680
implementation of some and many.

366
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,400
JAMIE: Right. So some is
the BNF plus then many is the star

367
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,160
using parse combinators surely
has a performance impact.

368
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,880
NICK: Right. Yes. So there's
definitely some overhead to using

369
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,600
these kinds of combinators.
But on the other hand,

370
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,720
if you represent these
combinators as a deep embedding

371
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,960
where the Combinators are
all data constructors,

372
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,560
then you can do things
like grammar analysis,

373
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,560
which is driven by various laws,

374
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,080
such as the applicative
and alternative laws.

375
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,000
JAMIE: I guess you could
optimize it that way.

376
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,040
I think it's easier to
understand performance by

377
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,760
thinking of an underlying
state machine.

378
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,040
NICK: What do you mean?

379
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,000
JAMIE: Well, you can represent
parsers as a machine with one

380
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,440
stack for intermediate results
and another for handling failure.

381
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,080
And then you parse by executing
instructions that interact

382
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,800
with these stacks when they're
given some input stream.

383
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,400
So I guess we would take your
previous parser as an example.

384
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:18,280
So here it would be.
NICK: Whoa, is that really still Haskell?

385
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,120
JAMIE: Yeah, sure. This is clearly
just a recursive machine reading,

386
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,280
alphabetical characters,
setting up failure handlers

387
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,200
before recursing again
and combining elements of the stack.

388
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,600
What's there not to understand?

389
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,520
Isn't this how you were
taught to use Haskell?

390
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,320
NICK: Well, I you'll have to go
a bit slower than that for me.

391
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,720
JAMIE: Right? Sure. So just read
those dollars as semi-colons and

392
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,360
your favorite imperative language.
Then alpha is similar to yours.

393
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,000
It's just an instruction
that verifies a

394
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,680
prediacate on the next input token,

395
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,760
and then continues with another
instruction K and alphas performs,

396
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,880
alpha and then leaves the
result on the stack.

397
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,480
It then does a catch block
to handle any failure.

398
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,120
And inside this block,
alphas is run again,

399
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,000
which leaves its result
on the stack too.

400
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,560
And the two results are
combined with left two cons.

401
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,720
Then things are free to carry on
with the next instruction K.

402
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,840
But if failure happens, then
the first instructions about

403
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,440
second block before the case
check that the input

404
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,320
hasn't changed since
starting to catch.

405
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,120
And the case instruction then
uses that information to either

406
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,400
fail or combine out for the empty list
before continuing with that same K.

407
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,920
NICK: Oh, I see. So your
representation is much

408
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,200
more explicit about
control flow than mine.

409
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,840
JAMIE: Yeah. Analyzing
the control from my machine is quite

410
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,880
straightforward. I think it's just
a lot more complex in your case.

411
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,320
NICK: Yeah. That's true. The control

412
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,640
flow for the grammar isn't obvious

413
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,400
at all, until you start looking
at something like derivatives.

414
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,000
JAMIE: Okay. Hang on. I think
I can see what's happening here.

415
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,600
The representation that
I have is the same as yours.

416
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,440
It's just been transformed into
CPS continuation parsing style.

417
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,280
That's what makes
the control flow explicit.

418
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,920
Basically each instruction
takes us an argument,

419
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,600
the next instruction executes.

420
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,240
And this is interpreted
by passing around two

421
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,880
continuations at runtime. The
good continuation and the bad one.

422
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,880
NICK: Of course. So if you
can convert between the

423
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,240
two representations, then you'll be
able to get both the high level

424
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,560
optimizations and grammar
analysis of my approach and

425
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,280
the low level optimizations
and control flow analysis of yours.

426
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,400
You get the best of both worlds.
There's a problem though.

427
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
The machine you showed
me before is untyped.

428
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,720
How can we convince ourselves
that the translation

429
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,360
is working properly? My
Combinator tree is fully typed.

430
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,120
JAMIE: Well, my stack represents
what's already been computed, right?

431
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,240
I guess in your world, that
corresponds to combinators

432
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,080
that have already been executed
and each Combinator will

433
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,280
push exactly one thing to
the stack. If it's successful.

434
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,960
NICK: So what if we can propagate
my type information into

435
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,800
a type level stack. Here,
let me show you what I mean.

436
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,560
So Halt is basically produces
a machine that expects

437
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,120
an A on an empty stack
and returns that A.

438
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,200
JAMIE: Whoa whoa whoa! Wait.
How does that get implemented?

439
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,680
NICK: I see you just use an H
list. It's a heterogeneous list

440
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,680
so that the values can
have different types.

441
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,760
The types of each elements are
kept in a type level list.

442
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,920
And this list is
the same as the one that

443
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,640
will appear in our
instruction types.

444
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,680
JAMIE: Oh, right. Okay.
Thanks for that, carry on.

445
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,720
NICK: Where was I? Okay,
so push take some X and

446
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,480
the machine that expects X
and Xs and produces a machine

447
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,880
that expects just Xs. And pop
takes the machine that expects

448
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,440
only the stack Xs
and produces a machine

449
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,840
that expects an X on
top of the stack Xs.

450
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,160
JAMIE: Right? I think I see. So
the continuation machine expects

451
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,880
a stack of a certain type
and then the instruction

452
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,600
will adapt that stack to fit.
I guess that compiling combinators

453
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,240
to a machine means taking
a machine that accepts the result and

454
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,200
makes progress towards
some final goal.

455
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,760
So that's something like this then.

456
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,760
CompileSub will take a parser
containing returning an A and

457
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,000
then a machine that accepts
that A along with some X's and

458
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,400
then we can build
a machine that requires

459
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,840
just that Xs in
order to continue.

460
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,200
And the final continuation
is going to be Halt.

461
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,720
It takes the one lement on
the stack and gives it back.

462
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,440
NICK: Right. So how would
you translate combinators?

463
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,080
So for example, the pure, which
has type A to parser A and app,

464
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,000
which has type parser A to B
to parser A to parser B.

465
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,360
JAMIE: Oh, easy,
something like this.

466
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,200
So for pure that's just the push
instruction, right.

467
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,680
With some N that will
continue on afterwards.

468
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,920
And then for app, we just
need to compile PF and

469
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,680
then we'll compile PX. And after
that, we combine the two results

470
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,000
that are on the stack with function
application using lift two.

471
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,880
NICK: Oh, neat. So what about
the and then variant of app where

472
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,480
discard the first argument,
rather than applying a function,

473
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,920
something like parser A
to parser B to parser B?

474
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,800
JAMIE: Oh, sure. All you need
to do is pop up to pass in the

475
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,280
first result so you compile P
then you pop that was off and

476
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,320
then you compile Q
and then carry on with M.

477
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,440
NICK: Oh, neat. So I can see
how this might work out.

478
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,680
You know, now that we can
see this as using CPS,

479
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,440
it kind of reminds me of some
work that my PhD student,

480
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,720
Matt Pickering has been
doing lately on staging.

481
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,000
Actually, there's a paper being
presented at the Haskell symposium

482
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,800
about it coming up in
just a couple of days.

483
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,920
JAMIE: So what staging exactly?

484
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,640
NICK: Alright. Well, so staging
as a form of meta programming,

485
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,760
where you can perform work on
statically known results ahead of

486
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,840
time leaving only
dynamic information

487
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,000
that runtime it's
basically giving you...

488
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,160
fine grained control over evaluation
in your compiler.

489
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,880
In our case the shape of the machine

490
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,240
for Parser and its
combinators is static.

491
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,960
In other words, it's
known by the compiler.

492
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,280
JAMIE WILLIS: I think
I understand so this means

493
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,440
we can perform that translation

494
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,200
from combinations to machine,

495
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,680
and evaluate most of
it, at compile time.

496
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,600
I've heard of template Haskell,

497
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,160
but that's untyped right.

498
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,240
It seems a bit of a waste
of all the hard work

499
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,640
we did to make everything
typed?

500
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,240
NICOLAS: Yeah, indeed and I guess

501
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,320
you haven't heard of typed template Haskell.

502
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,400
Unlike template Haskell
where you build AST's with

503
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,440
typed template Haskell
you can only work with

504
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,920
well typed terms which
ensures that the processes is safe,

505
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,600
For example, if you
have some term E of type A,

506
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,360
then it could be quoted
to get the code

507
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,600
that represents E at
run time,

508
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,480
quoting, which is of type code A.

509
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,400
If you want to splice
or run some code

510
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,680
you simply use the anti
quotes by adding a dollar

511
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,320
to the front so for some
code C of type code A

512
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,160
Splice C gives back
a value of type A.

513
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,160
JAMIE: Oh, so what I have to do,
is code to the parts

514
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,640
that are gonna happen at runtime.

515
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,840
NICOLAS: Yep.

516
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,400
JAMIE: OK, so let's have a look

517
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,880
at the machine state the where it's interpreted

518
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,080
and see what we can
uncover.

519
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,920
So quickly, let's look at how we actually
evaluate the machine,

520
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,680
normally with the run
machine function.

521
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,840
So, we're going to
provide some machine

522
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,520
state gamma to the eval function,

523
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,760
and that's going to interpret

524
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,680
the meaning of each instruction.

525
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,920
So, all gamma is is just a

526
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,400
our heterogeneous open
stack along with a return

527
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,960
continuation
for recursion a stack

528
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,440
for failure handlers
and the input xs itself.

529
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,200
And so the bit that we can actually

530
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,240
stage about this would
be the eval function,

531
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,800
because it's the machine

532
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,600
that's done at compile time, right.

533
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,840
So, if I just add code around it,

534
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,800
then that makes
the function from machine

535
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
state to final value code

536
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,840
and that, that'll be done at run time.

537
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,320
And you can break this into
a compile time function

538
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,720
that takes code and returns code

539
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,360
that's fairly straightforward,

540
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,240
but we should get to
more than this, right.

541
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,400
So the machines take gammas
always the same shape,

542
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,120
so we should be able to get rid
of that at compile time too.

543
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,600
So if I push the code
into the gamma,

544
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,280
then we can ensure it
only exist at a compile time.

545
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,800
Yeah so runtime will produce
a function with four arguments,

546
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,560
one for each component,
but the actual records gone.

547
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,960
There's sort of this, gonna
be more we can do now.

548
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,240
NICOLAS: Well,
the fact that, H list.

549
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,720
In ops has the type Xs implies,

550
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,880
but it must have those, shape that
we can do at compile time.

551
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,920
And that's determined by instructions

552
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,240
also known at compile time.

553
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,000
So you could push the code
inside the H list.

554
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,280
JAMIE: I see, so, if I map

555
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,720
the code over the values in the H list,

556
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,800
then the H list itself is only
going to exist at compile time,

557
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,840
and the values exist at runtime.

558
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,160
And I guess the structure,
the handle stack is

559
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,480
the same it's determined by
the instructions as well.

560
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,480
So I guess we can operate that
list at compile time too.

561
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,560
So, with all things considered,

562
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,080
I guess the only thing
we don't really know

563
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,480
at compile time is
what the input is,

564
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,400
and specifically what each
continuation is at any given point.

565
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,000
Everything else is gone

566
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,840
NICOLAS: Exactly and that's why we

567
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,360
like staging so much.

568
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,000
JAMIE: Awesome, so here's what
the staged evaluation

569
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,880
for push and halt
look like then.

570
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,840
So, halt will take
the operand stack out of gamma

571
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,240
and extract the top element

572
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,080
and splice it into some code

573
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,520
that builds it just for
that value at run time,

574
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,080
and eval push there aren't
actually any quotes

575
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,040
in the body at all,
 so it must purely happen at compile time.

576
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,160
That's really cool.

577
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,040
So, I guess let's
push

578
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,160
an example through this mechanism

579
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,600
and see what code it generates.

580
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,560
Wow, this is, this is quite cool,

581
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,960
so I guess we can see that
none of the abstractions

582
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,880
from the combinators in
the machine are here at all.

583
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,560
It's literally just a couple of
functions, taking this argument,

584
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,480
this good continuation
the bad continuation.

585
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,920
And some input and it'll
all thread around together,

586
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,160
this is, this is awesome.

587
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,000
NICOLAS: Yeah, it is,
it's really good.

588
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,640
But there is a small problem.

589
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,400
Most parser combinators
such as parsec

590
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,320
this combinator called bind,
which is usually used

591
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,360
to implement context
sensitive parsing

592
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,920
the stuff that was previously parsed

593
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
can influence the grammar,

594
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,600
that is used to parse the rest.

595
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,080
The trouble is that I don't
think this can be staged.

596
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,800
JAMIE: That's a pain,

597
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,040
I mean do you really need
to create a whole new parser

598
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,160
so that we can't inspect,

599
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,960
what sort of things do you
actually use it for.

600
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,520
NICOLAS: I suppose, most of the time
the grammar is static,

601
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,800
and bind is used to select

602
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,600
the part of the grammar
that's already known.

603
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,400
JAMIE: Oh, well we've already
seen an operation

604
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,000
like that right?
 it was it was case.

605
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,000
So both of the outcomes
are known statically,

606
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,000
but you don't know which path
is taken until runtime.

607
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,400
NICOLAS: Interesting.

608
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,320
I wonder if this corresponds
to Marco's work on selected functors,

609
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,680
it seems to behave similarly
to his branch operation

610
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,120
which arbitrates between two
branches depending on a coproduct.

611
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,680
JAMIE: Yeah, I think that
sounds about right.

612
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,560
NICOLAS: Great, so if you give up bind
and work with selectors

613
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,640
instead we can use staging,
and that makes things really fast.

614
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,680
JAMIE: Let me
quickly whip something up

615
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,920
and we can see how it performs
on some benchmarks, I made earlier.

616
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,000
NICOLAS: Wow. Kids these days are really
fast at programming things.

617
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,600
JAMIE: Perfect. It works first
time that's unusual

618
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,160
It must be there's strong types.

619
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,520
Right here's the results.

620
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,680
So, this graph is showing us

621
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,720
that actually compared
to the other combinator

622
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,320
libraries we're about three
or four times faster,

623
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,720
and we're even beating happy

624
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,360
that's a parser generator library.

625
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,200
NICOLAS: Wow, that's
really good performance.

626
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,840
JAMIE: Yeah, this is great.

627
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,360
Maybe we should write
a paper about this.

628
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,840
NICOLAS: Well, you're pretty good
at coding things quickly

629
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,720
and I'm pretty good at writing
papers quickly, so here you go.

630
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,560
Cool. I'm gonna stop
recording now I think.

631
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:38,600
BACKGROUND CLAPPING

632
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,640
ALAN JEFFREY: OK, thank you, Jamie and Nic.

633
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,360
So if you want to
join the authors for

634
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,880
a Q&A in the New York time zone.

635
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,160
Then you can click on
the link in the Clowdr room,

636
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,040
Hello and welcome back to

637
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,240
the second session for ICFP 2020.

638
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,880
And our next talk is going to
be, Kindly Bent to Free Us,

639
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,680
and it's going to be presented
by Gabriel Radanne.

640
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,880
GABRIEL RADANNE: Hi everyone

641
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,000
so I'm Gabriel Radanne

642
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,520
and I'm going to talk to you

643
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,400
about memory safety
for a little while.

644
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,000
Here is a report provided
by the Chromium team

645
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,120
about high severity
security bugs in chromium,

646
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,320
and you can see that
almost two thirds

647
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,480
of the bugs in chromium
are memory related,

648
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,160
and one third of the bugs, are simple
use after free errors.

649
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,840
So you could say OK.

650
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,200
Chromium is written in
a mix of C and C++

651
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,880
and surely these don't happen

652
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,360
in high level typed languages. Right.

653
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,680
Let's write OCaml code.

654
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,040
Here is a small example of code
where we open a database,

655
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,200
we write a grade database of grades,

656
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:05,000
we write some grade into
the database so that's great,

657
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,040
we close the database, then we try

658
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,160
to read the literature
grade, and print it.

659
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,800
So the OCaml type checker
will happily type check

660
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,720
and compile this program,

661
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,320
and later on we'll have
runtime error. So,

662
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:29,360
there are various ways to, deal with
this kind of errors,

663
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,120
and today I'm going to present Affe,

664
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,200
which is an ML like language

665
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,520
that prevent precisely
this kind of error.

666
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,520
So here is the same program
written in Affe.

667
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,040
It looks very much like the ML program

668
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,760
the program from before,

669
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,160
except this time when we
reach the last line

670
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,040
and the type checker will refuse
at compile time, this program.

671
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,600
So we have a few
specificity in Affe.

672
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,680
The first one is that we use
kinds, to determine usage.

673
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,000
So, here is a grade database
is of type database,

674
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,960
and the database is kind of linear.

675
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,360
And so this resource
must be use linearly,

676
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,960
and when it's closed, you
don't use it anymore.

677
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,720
On the contrary, here we
have the math string

678
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,560
and string are unrestricted.

679
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,400
And so you can you can use them
in unrestricted fashions.

680
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,280
Furthermore, we have borrows,
so as present in rust

681
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,280
and other languages
borrows allows

682
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,040
to do imperative programming
very conveniently

683
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,960
and that's why we use them here.

684
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,760
Finally, the final
specificity of affe

685
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,840
is that we have complete
type inference.

686
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,360
So before I used.

687
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,800
I used a type annotation here

688
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:56,200
to simplify, to make
it easier to read.

689
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:01,320
But I don't need to. Here
type is completely inferred.

690
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,520
So, to present Affe, I'm going to
go through various of its features,

691
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,840
and I'm going to start by linearity.

692
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,560
So as I said before
kinds determine usage.

693
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:17,040
We have three kinds linear, resource
must be used exactly once.

694
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,960
Affine or resource must be used
exactly at most one zero ones.

695
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,440
And unrestricted
the object can use

696
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,480
arbitrary many times
from zero to infinity.

697
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,080
Here are a few examples.

698
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,400
We have a database type of

699
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:38,720
kind lin, a string type of type,
of kind unrestricted.

700
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,400
We can also have parameterized kind.

701
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,840
So, for example, a list.

702
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,040
As the kind of content,

703
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,880
if we have a list of database.

704
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,400
Then, this must be used linearly.

705
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,120
If we have a list of strings,

706
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,160
it can be used in
an unrestricted fashion

707
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,760
to use these kind of parameters kind

708
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,440
We also have kind constraints.

709
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,840
So here, we can, a we
have the type function,

710
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,920
create list which takes an element

711
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
and replicates it multiple
time to create a list.

712
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,480
Since the element is
going to be replicated.

713
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,720
Because then naturally,

714
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,120
its content must be unrestricted.

715
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,440
And that's exactly what
this constraint says.

716
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,120
Finally, we also use subkinding,

717
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,880
so un is smaller than f
which is smaller than lin.

718
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:36,040
And that means that if a function
only expect linear objects,

719
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,560
we can pass it unrestricted objects.

720
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,240
And the reason is that if something

721
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,960
can be used in unrestricted fashion,

722
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,320
in particular, it can
be used linearly

723
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,760
This is the base of our language,

724
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,960
and we're going to
use it to build up everything else.

725
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,920
And in particular,
functions and captures.

726
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:01,400
So here's a piece of code where
we open the grade database.

727
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,640
Then we create a function
that logs, some message,

728
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,240
and then close the database.

729
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,880
As you can see, we
have a capture here,

730
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,200
the login, login close
function captures

731
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,960
a grade database and grade,
a grade database is linear,

732
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,800
it must be used exactly once.

733
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:24,640
And so, the log function must
also be called exactly once.

734
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,400
If we ask the Affe checker

735
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,720
it's going to give us
this type, string arrow

736
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,360
Annotated by Lin, and unit,

737
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,760
and the annotation on
the arrow indicates

738
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,960
that, indicates
the usage of this function,

739
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
it indicates that log n close
must be called exactly once.

740
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,680
If you're wanting to
make everything here.

741
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,920
This will, this annotation,

742
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,400
does not say anything
about the argument.

743
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,640
Here the argument is of type
string so it's unrestricted,

744
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,560
you can do whatever
you want with it.

745
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,760
The arrow and in particular
this linear arrow

746
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,920
is not early but from linear logic.

747
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,960
It only says something
about the function itself

748
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,440
All right, so we can do.

749
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,480
Nice functional
programming with all this.

750
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,560
Let's look about imperative.

751
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,160
Let's look at imperative
programming,

752
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,040
and for that we need
borrows and regions

753
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,640
as in Rust and other languages,

754
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,040
a borrow is a temporary
loan of a resource, A.

755
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,760
And we have two types
of  borrow.

756
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,080
Shared burrows for
observing the resource

757
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,920
and Exclusive burrows are
for modifying the resource.

758
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,680
Here is an example of
a correct use of borrow.

759
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:53,080
We start by looking up,
two grades concurrently

760
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,560
so this is a read action so we use

761
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,600
a shared borrow for observing the data.

762
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,520
Since it's since it's shared,

763
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:06,040
we can look up two things at
the same time concurrently,

764
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,280
and in particular the kind
of this is unrestricted.

765
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,800
Once we are done with looking up

766
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,200
these two grades
and making their average,

767
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:20,040
we can write in the database
using an exclusive borrow

768
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,000
and exclusive are, as
I said, exclusive

769
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,120
and they are, in particular,
of kind affine.

770
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,720
So there are a few rules
to use this borrows.

771
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,040
The first rule is that
we, you cannot use

772
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:39,120
a borrow and the resource,
itself, at the same time.

773
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:43,800
Here, the f function is
called with the resource,

774
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,360
and a borrow, and that's not allowed

775
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,240
as a type checker will reject this.

776
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,360
A second rule is that
we can not use an

777
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:57,320
exclusive borrow and any
other borrow, so here,

778
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,200
I have an exclusive
borrow and another borrow,

779
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,480
and the type checker
will again reject this.

780
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,440
Finally, a borrow must not escape.

781
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,840
Here we have
a declaration of database

782
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:17,240
and then pair composed
which contains a borrow.

783
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,320
And then we try to leak the borrow

784
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:23,000
while the database is still
capture inside the function.

785
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,600
So this is not allowed
because the borrow

786
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,000
is escaping it's region.

787
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,680
And here is the region,
delimiting a borrow.

788
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:36,040
So the regions are
almost lexical scoping

789
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,280
with a few tweaks
and the way we check

790
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:43,400
for this kind of escape is
by using the indexed kinds

791
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,160
so before I said the kinds were
unrestricted affine and linear.

792
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,680
Actually there are a bit more

793
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,720
zero indexed by the nesting.

794
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,800
And here the grade, the borrow

795
00:51:54,800 --> 00:52:00,200
of the database is in
a second nesting,

796
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:04,080
so it's annotated by un two.

797
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:09,360
Whereas, the region around it
is at the nesting level one.

798
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,680
And so we will simply check
two is bigger than one,

799
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,280
so the borrow cannot escape.

800
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,120
And the type checker will
again, rejects this.

801
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,000
Alright so we have borrow,
we have closure, we have functions,

802
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,040
we have linearity let's
put everything together.

803
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,400
Here is the API for the database

804
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,080
that they've used since
the beginning of this talk.

805
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,040
the type database is of linear kind,

806
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,360
we have defined functions,
that takes a borrow.

807
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:43,200
With its kind, and takes
the string and return an integer.

808
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,880
We have the add function that
takes an exclusive borrow.

809
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,600
a string, an integer
and returns units.

810
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,720
And since the functions
are currified,

811
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,280
you can, here the database borrow

812
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,160
is captured later on
and so the functions

813
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,200
are annotated with
the kind that is capture here.

814
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,640
Here is a simple use of this API,

815
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,440
as I said, which was
presented before.

816
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,680
So we have, two concurrent
Lookups,

817
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:21,760
grade Db, of the grade
DB of two grade that math and compsci.

818
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,080
And then we compute the average.

819
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:27,080
We can factorize a little bit the

820
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,240
lookup aspect

821
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,920
by creating a grade function
that captures a database,

822
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,920
and look up the topic
or the subjects of the grade.

823
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,360
And here we repeat
the argument subject and subject.

824
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,760
so we can simply partially
applies a function,

825
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,960
and it will compute the borrows
and the kinds accordingly.

826
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,480
And finally we can even go further

827
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:58,000
and use a function
attraction to pull

828
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,080
the function computing
the average outside

829
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,680
by taking a list of subjects

830
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,880
and applying a partially
applied function in list of map,

831
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,560
and so on and so forth,
and use any other functions

832
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,080
as we would want to
in a functional language

833
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,440
The type checker will
annotate the region

834
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,680
as we would expect, here we are

835
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,640
the disjoined region
for the shared borrow

836
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,000
and the exclusive borrow

837
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,600
and they are perfectly disjoined.

838
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,320
Finally, as we said before,

839
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,920
we have no type annotations,

840
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,000
so even if I used the average.

841
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:46,040
Even if I lifted
the average function, I

842
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,400
I still have no type annotation

843
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,520
here we have complete
type inference.

844
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,560
Alright so let's, look a little bit

845
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,280
under the hood at
inference and constraint.

846
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,160
The first step is to
elaborate the region.

847
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,280
By using the information provided

848
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,840
by the position of the borrow,
the scopes of the borrow

849
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,920
and the borrowing rules I presented,

850
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,000
which allow us to
completely determine

851
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,680
the biggest region
we could use.

852
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,680
Again second step is to
generate constraint,

853
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,880
which we encode, type
linearity and borrowing checks.

854
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,360
And to prove - check that

855
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,840
nothing escapes that shouldn't.

856
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:30,000
This constraint system
is custom to encode.

857
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,400
the rule we want
and based on HM(X).

858
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,960
Finally, we solve the constraints

859
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,960
using custom algorithms
that we provide,

860
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:47,120
and we obtain principal type schemes
for all the functions in our program.

861
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:50,800
So this principle type
scheme can sometimes still

862
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,320
be a little bit complicated,

863
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:58,240
and so we use subkinding rules
with positive and negative position

864
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:03,400
to simplify the type further down.

865
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:10,240
Alright, and so we obtain, finally,
the simple type schemes.

866
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,160
So to summarize, I presented
the Affe language,

867
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:19,160
a prototype is available
at this address online.

868
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,240
We've provided Linearity,
Closure, Borrows and Regions,

869
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,440
to provide good support

870
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,080
for both imperative
and functional programming,

871
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,440
we support managed
and unmanaged objects,

872
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,960
and principal and type inference,
which is something very noble,

873
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,800
for which type support borrows.

874
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:40,640
The downside is that so far we do
not support real flow sensitivity,

875
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:45,760
we can emulate this a bit,
but it has no proper support,

876
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:49,120
and we do not have yet
a concurrency story

877
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,120
so that's something
we're working on.

878
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,240
In the paper you can
find many many examples

879
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,640
to show that we can indeed support
many types of programming,

880
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,480
both functional imperative.

881
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:08,080
On the theory side, we provide
a syntax-directed type system for Affe,

882
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:12,720
how to encode into
an ML-style type-system,

883
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,680
we provide the formal account
semantics and proof of soundness,

884
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,200
and an inference algorithm for Affe,

885
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:25,640
which provide values, novel
contribution in particular

886
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,760
an extension to HM(X),
novel constraint system

887
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:33,440
and it's constraint algorithm
and proof of completeness.

888
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,200
That's all I have.
Thank you very much.

889
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:40,200

the Clowdr room for this paper.

893
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:04,760
Hello and welcome back to
the second session of ICFP 2020.

894
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,560
And our next paper is going to be

895
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:11,680
'Sealing Pointer-based Optimizations
behind Pure Functions',

896
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,120
and it's going to be
presented by Daniel Selsam.

897
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,120
DANIEL SELSAM: Everybody,

898
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,200
my name is Daniel Selsam
from Microsoft Research.

899
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,360
I'll be presenting joint work with
Simon Hudon from Carnegie Mellon,

900
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:27,040
and my colleague Leonardo de
Moura from Microsoft Research.

901
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,440
Our paper is titled,

902
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:32,640
'Sealing Pointer-based Optimizations
behind Pure Functions'.

903
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,560
Now, functional programming

904
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,840
really shines for
interactive theorem provers.

905
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,320
For many reasons.

906
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,360
It's easy to encode terms
with inductive types,

907
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:46,640
and this is actually
surprisingly cumbersome in C++.

908
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,200
It's easy to traverse terms
with higher-order combinators,

909
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:55,080
for example, it's easy to write
functions that replace sub-terms

910
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,200
of terms, or find sub-terms
matching patterns.

911
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:02,320
And it's easy to backtrack using
persistent data-structures.

912
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:05,960
So, we can just snapshot the world,

913
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:09,920
try tactic one in that
world and if it fails,

914
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,920
in constant time and no
extra programming effort,

915
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:16,840
we can just roll back
the world to the snapshot

916
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:21,120
before we started tac1 and then
try the second tactic in it.

917
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:24,040
And as we would expect, most
interactive thorem provers

918
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,920
are written in functional
programming languages.

919
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:31,360
So, Isabelle/HOL is written in
Poly/ML, Coq is written in OCaml,

920
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,760
Agda and Idris are
written in Haskell

921
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:38,760
and Lean3 was written in C++
at great spiritual cost,

922
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,640
but Lean4 is being
rewritten in Lean4 itself,

923
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,600
which is a functional
programming language.

924
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,880
But while functional programming
shines in this domain,

925
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,160
pure languages suffer
a critical limitation

926
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,080
that we call Purity's Achilles Heal.

927
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:58,840
Which is that, "Traversing
a term requires time proportional

928
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:03,440
to the tree size of the term,
as opposed to its graph size,

929
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,000
which causes exponential blowup
in theory and in practice."

930
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,160
And here's a little illustration.

931
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:15,120
On the left, there's a term
whose DAG representation

932
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:19,960
has only four nodes, and in fact,
has only four nodes in memory,

933
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:23,280
but when you view it as a tree, it
has two to the four minus one node.

934
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,360
So, exponentially more nodes
in its tree representation

935
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,920
than in its graph representation.

936
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,360
And perhaps a surprising
empirical finding

937
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,840
is that terms with
astronomic tree sizes

938
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,560
are actually extremely common in
interactive theorem provers.

939
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:43,280
So, it's well known that even
basic operations can produce them.

940
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:50,440
So unifying two terms, where
the function symbol has arity n,

941
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:55,560
can produce a term whose
tree size is two to the n.

942
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,440
But this is a somewhat
contrived example.

943
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,600
But in reality, terms are often
the result of long chains

944
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:06,800
of somewhat arbitrary user-written
meta programs or tactics.

945
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,600
And at least in Lean's
mathematical library - Mathlib,

946
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:14,840
it's not uncommon for a proof
that has only 20,000 nodes

947
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,560
in its DAG representation

948
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:20,640
to have over 2 billion nodes
in its tree representation.

949
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,880
And many performance issues in Coq
and Lean going back many years

950
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,400
have been the result of improper
handling of such terms

951
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,040
despite having the needed
impure tools at hand.

952
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:35,160
Basically, the exponential
blow up is so severe

953
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,880
that if a single module
ever traverses a term

954
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,200
with insufficiently precise caching

955
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,520
is very likely going
to be a bottleneck.

956
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:48,120
And now we can talk
about our contribution.

957
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:53,120
So, we present a new way to, quote,
'Seal' the needed optimizations -

958
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:57,160
the optimizations that you need to
traverse terms in linear time.

959
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,320
We show how to seal
these optimizations

960
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,000
behind pure functional interfaces.

961
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,600
And here's the main idea.

962
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,160
We start with a pure
reference implementation

963
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:10,320
of something that we want to optimize,

964
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,960
we find sufficient conditions
for a particular optimization

965
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,800
to respect the reference
implementation,

966
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,000
we then create a new primitive
that takes these conditions

967
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,240
as 'preconditions'
using dependent types

968
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:27,240
and otherwise is given the nominal
pure reference implementation.

969
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:31,520
And then we just compile this
primitive into the optimized version.

970
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,080
And a simple meta theoretic argument

971
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,000
establishes that
since it was proved -

972
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,400
since the preconditions were approved,
the optimization is settled.

973
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,320
And we show how to do
this for several common

974
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:47,080
low-level optimizations,
including pointer equality tests,

975
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,040
and even direct
pointer-address manipulations.

976
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,080
And we show how to use
these new primitives

977
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,720
to traverse terms in linear time,

978
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,720
which is the problem
we set out to solve.

979
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,600
So, perhaps the simplest
pointer optimization

980
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:04,280
is just short-circuiting equality
tests using pointer equality.

981
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,160
And the idea is simple:

982
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,560
If two terms x and y have
the same memory address,

983
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,640
they must be structurally equal.

984
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:16,840
So, you can skip the potentially
exponentially expensive

985
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,760
structural equality test
and just return true.

986
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,880
And the challenge here is
that this optimization

987
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:26,400
is only sound in general
for reflexive relations.

988
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,760
And the solution is somewhat simple:

989
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:33,680
Allow the optimization any relation
that you can prove is reflexive.

990
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,520
Which brings us to our
first new primitive

991
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,000
which we call, 'withPtrEq'.

992
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,720
And now, withPtrEq takes two
terms x and y of type alpha,

993
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:47,880
and a thunk, k, that takes
a unit type and returns Bool.

994
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:54,240
And the precondition, h,
is a proof that if x=y,

995
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,480
then this thunk, k, is
going to return true.

996
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,760
And then the overall primitive
withPtrEq returns Bool,

997
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:05,400
and it's pure reference implementation
just simply evaluates the thunk.

998
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,360
And now, the compiler will
treat this as opaque

999
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,960
until reaching the low-level IR.

1000
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:15,360
At which point it will
expand a call to withPtrEq,

1001
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:18,280
to the following
pseudo code snippet:

1002
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:22,320
It first checks of the pointer
addresses are the same of x and y,

1003
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:25,880
if they are it returns true,
otherwise it evaluates it up.

1004
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:29,160
And the precondition, h,
guarantees that this version

1005
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:33,280
respects the pure version
by a very simple argument.

1006
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,240
Now, withPtrEq alone already
can yield exponential speedups

1007
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:40,400
on pointer-equal terms trivially.

1008
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,800
But small deviations from
pointer-equal from pointer-equality

1009
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,640
remove the benefit entirely.

1010
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,800
So, this is
an illustration of two terms

1011
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:54,680
that share memory pointer
share an enormous tower,

1012
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,280
but their heads are
actually different.

1013
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:00,800
So, they are not themselves PtrEq,
even though their children are.

1014
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:04,040
So, a single call to withPtrEq

1015
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,080
will just see that they're
not pointer-equal,

1016
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:10,080
and fall back on recursive
structural equality.

1017
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:14,520
Obviously, what we want is to
call withPtrEq recursively

1018
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:18,000
on the children, and we can do that.

1019
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,600
The construction is
somewhat elaborate,

1020
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:23,640
but it's entirely mechanizable,
requires no new primitives,

1021
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:28,160
and the paper goes into
the details for those who are curious.

1022
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:32,000
Now we're almost ready to
traverse terms in linear-time.

1023
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,920
Consider the naive
exponential time algorithm

1024
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:39,960
to evaluate a simple arithmetic
term into a natural number.

1025
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,680
So, then here we have a term type

1026
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,880
that has two constructors
one and add.

1027
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,080
So, we can just evaluate
this into a map

1028
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,520
by mapping one to the numeral one,

1029
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:54,160
and by evaluating add t1,
t2, by first evaluating t1,

1030
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,480
and evaluating t2, and adding
the results together.

1031
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:01,080
Now, we're gonna show how to use
withPtrEq the recursive version,

1032
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:05,000
to build a linear-time
version of this algorithm.

1033
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
We need two additional components,

1034
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,320
we need constant-time
intrusive hashing,

1035
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,920
and we need something that we
call 'sharing the common data'

1036
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,120
which I'll discuss shortly.

1037
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:18,760
So, it's almost hard to believe
but even just computing the hash

1038
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,040
of a tower requires
exponential time.

1039
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:25,920
But hashing, unlike equality,
is a unary function.

1040
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,480
So, in principal, we can compute it
once and just store it somewhere.

1041
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,400
Which brings us to
this folklore trick,

1042
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,120
which we call intrusive hashing,

1043
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:38,400
which is to simply extend
the term type itself

1044
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,480
to store the hashes of the terms

1045
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,080
as extra arguments to
the constructors.

1046
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:46,600
So, here the third argument
to add is an adder,

1047
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,840
which is just our type that
represents hashes in this case,

1048
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,480
and we can write a fast
constant-time hash function

1049
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,720
that simply projects
out of this hash field.

1050
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,040
And we can write a smart constructor

1051
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:02,640
that internally calls
the built in constructor,

1052
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,840
but will compute
the hash automatically

1053
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:08,560
using the fast hash on the children.

1054
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:12,280
Now, Lean4 has reference counting
and disruptive-updates,

1055
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:15,360
so, we can actually use
imperative hash tables

1056
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:19,240
and get the desired expected
O(1) lookup time.

1057
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:21,840
But, if your language does
not have this feature,

1058
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:25,520
then you can still use functional
or persistent hash tables,

1059
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:29,400
and then all of the same
constructions applied,

1060
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:34,400
but everytime we say linear really
means quasi-linear for you.

1061
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:42,520
Now, the semi-naive traversal,
we call evalFastEqFastHash.

1062
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:47,920
Which is to use the recursive
withPtrEq test for the equality,

1063
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:51,840
and to also cache using
the constant-time

1064
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:55,080
intrusive cache and a hash cache.

1065
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:58,360
Now, this is already linear
time on this example,

1066
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:01,200
strictly because of
the recursive withPtrEq.

1067
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,880
And because of
the intrusive hash cache,

1068
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:09,200
is also linear time on this
example, in expectation because,

1069
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,920
with high probability the hashes
are going to be different,

1070
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,640
and in the small chance
that they're the same,

1071
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:20,520
they're very unlikely to be the same
again for the children and so on.

1072
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,200
But this semi-naive algorithm

1073
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,160
is still exponential
time on this example,

1074
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:32,320
where we have two structurally equal
terms that are pointer disjoint.

1075
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:35,000
And this brings us to
sharing the common data.

1076
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,520
So, with low-level
pointer manipulations,

1077
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,440
we can, quote, 'share
the common data' in linear-time.

1078
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:45,280
And what we mean by that is
to take a term like this

1079
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:49,480
that has multiple sub-terms
that are structurally equal,

1080
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,960
but pointer disjoint,

1081
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,320
and simply share the common
data or contact to the term

1082
01:08:55,320 --> 01:09:00,600
and produce the term such that
equality implies pointer-equality

1083
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:03,200
of all sub-terms inside the term.

1084
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:07,280
And now in the paper, we
introduce additional primitives

1085
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:11,000
that allow writing pure
versions of this procedure

1086
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,480
from first principles
in linear time.

1087
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:16,360
But, as part of the Lean runtime,

1088
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:19,680
we already have a high performance
version of this procedure

1089
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,800
that applies to objects of any type.

1090
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:25,000
So, there's no additional trust
required to simply expose it.

1091
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,960
So, we present a new
primitive shareCommon

1092
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,640
that is just the identity function

1093
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,960
whose reference implementation
is just the identity function,

1094
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,320
it actually takes no
additional preconditions.

1095
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,520
But under the hood,

1096
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:41,520
it's going to share the common
- use the runtime support

1097
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:45,200
to share the common data inside x.

1098
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:49,120
And finally, we have a robust
linear-time traversal,

1099
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,240
which we are - to be
overly pedantic,

1100
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:57,040
call evalFastEqFastHashShareCommon,
and the idea is simple,

1101
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:00,800
we first share the common data
which takes linear-time,

1102
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,760
and then we call evalFastEqFastHash,

1103
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:08,920
which is linear-time as long as
the data is being maximally shared.

1104
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,000
And our motto in general
is if terms are equal,

1105
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
they should be pointer-equal,

1106
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,360
and they will definitely be
pointer-equal after shareCommon.

1107
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:21,200
And if terms are not equal,
their constant-time hashes

1108
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,360
should not be equal
with high probability.

1109
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,160
Now, the paper covers
many extensions

1110
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:29,360
and alternatives to this approach.

1111
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,960
I'll go through a couple
examples very briefly.

1112
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,560
So, we can have
a pointer equality test

1113
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,560
without requiring
reflexivity as follows.

1114
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:42,120
Here's a primitive withPtrEqResult
that takes two terms x and y.

1115
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,160
And instead of a thunk, k,

1116
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:47,280
it's a continuation that gets
to see an optional proof

1117
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,720
that x equals y.

1118
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:50,440
But instead of returning a Bool in,

1119
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:53,560
it returns an element
of any type beta.

1120
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,120
And now the precondition we need

1121
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,480
is that no matter what
proof we give it,

1122
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,160
or what optional proof we give it,

1123
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:02,080
this continuation is gonna
return the same value.

1124
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:06,040
And the reference implementation
just calls it on none.

1125
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:09,080
But at runtime, if x
and y are pointer-equal,

1126
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:12,200
we call it with
the proof of reflexivity.

1127
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:16,600
And we can also support direct
pointer address manipulation

1128
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,560
with the new primitive withPtrAddr,

1129
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:23,520
which takes a term x whose
address we wanna inspect

1130
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:28,560
and it takes a continuation, k, that
is going to look at that address

1131
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:32,000
and again, return an element
of an arbitrary type beta.

1132
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,880
And the precondition we need here

1133
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:38,920
is that no matter what address we
give k, k returns the same value.

1134
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,960
And then the reference
implementation

1135
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:45,000
just evaluates k at
an arbitrary value, zero,

1136
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,320
whereas the optimized
version will evaluate k

1137
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,680
on the actual memory address of x.

1138
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:55,840
And the proof very
trivially implies that

1139
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:00,240
the optimized version is
functionally indistinguishable

1140
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,720
from the pure reference
implementation.

1141
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:05,400
Perhaps the surprising
part of this is that

1142
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,800
this precondition
isn't too restrictive.

1143
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,280
And we show in the paper
that indeed we can do

1144
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:14,840
many many sophisticated
constructions using withPtrAddr.

1145
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:18,600
And in fact, combining
withPtrEqResult and withPtrAddr,

1146
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,160
we can implement pointer
caches from first principals,

1147
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:26,400
and we can implement shareCommon
from first principals, and so forth.

1148
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:31,400
We recommend the
FastEqFastHashShareCommon approach

1149
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,720
in general. It gives very good performance in
all our use cases in practice,

1150
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,240
it's simple,

1151
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:39,720
and the other constructions are
significantly more elaborate

1152
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,120
for very little payoff.

1153
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,840
And thank you, that's all
we have time for today.

Welcome back to ICFP 2020,

1160
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:19,560
where the next paper is going to
be, "Effects for Efficiency:

1161
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,400
Asymptotic Speedup with
First-Class Control,"

1162
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:27,400
and it's going to be presented
by Daniel Hillerstrom.

1163
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,520
DANIEL HILLERSTROM: Hi, my
name is Daniel Hillerstom,

1164
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,760
and I'd like to tell you about
some recent work I've done

1165
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,720
with Sam Lindley and John Longley,

1166
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,800
on how the presence of
first-class control

1167
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:39,200
your language can speed up
implementations of some programs.

1168
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,400
I'll dive right in.

1169
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,080
The purpose of this work is
really to explore space.

1170
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:44,200
The space I have in mind here

1171
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,600
is the design space of
programming languages.

1172
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:49,360
When studying the expressiveness
of some language feature,

1173
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,760
like first class control,

1174
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,600
it is customary to consider
language with the said feature,

1175
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,120
and then the fragment
modulo that feature.

1176
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:58,920
Then we could pose questions along
different dimensions success,

1177
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
computability...

1178
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,320
complexity
and programmability.

1179
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:05,240
However, any type of question
is really only interesting

1180
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,640
if the setting involves
higher types,

1181
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,480
because to a fair approximation,

1182
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,640
we can regard all
reasonable languages,

1183
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:15,000
with first-order types
as being equally expressive.

1184
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,560
So in this work, we are in
the realm of higher types,

1185
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:18,720
and we show that in this realm,

1186
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,760
the presence of first
class control can improve

1187
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:23,880
the asymptotic run time
of some programs.

1188
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:26,160
To show this, we consider
this generic count problem

1189
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,760
which is asked to implement
the third-order function

1190
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,800
satisfying this type signature.

1191
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,040
Let's unpack the type.

1192
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:35,240
The first order function
parameter is called a point.

1193
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:36,560
It is a functional representation

1194
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,360
of a boolean value vector of size N.

1195
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,840
The second order parameter
is a predicate function,

1196
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,520
which operates on points.

1197
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,640
It is an encoding of
some search problem,

1198
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,760
and it yields true
or false depending on

1199
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,840
where it is satisfied
by its provided point.

1200
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:54,480
Finally, any faithful implementation
of this type signature

1201
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,720
ultimately returns
the number of points

1202
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:00,080
satisfying a given predicate,
or in other words,

1203
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:03,760
it counts to number of times
a given predicate returns true.

1204
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,760
We fix our base language
to be simple typed PCF

1205
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,080
and extended with effect handlers.

1206
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:12,760
Our concrete choice of control
operator is not essential.

1207
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,920
Any first class control
operator will do,

1208
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:17,080
however effect handlers
still provide a particular

1209
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,960
structure form of
the limited control,

1210
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,720
which makes them convenient
for the purpose of this work.

1211
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,680
Then we first show that there
exists an implementation

1212
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,000
of that generic count in PCF
for the effect handlers,

1213
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,760
whose asymptotic worst
case runtime behavior

1214
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,440
is two to the N.

1215
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:35,000
Then we show that every
implementation of generic count

1216
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,560
in pure PCF has at least
asymptotic runtime behavior

1217
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,080
N two to the N.

1218
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,280
That is to say there exist

1219
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:44,080
a strict asymptotic efficiency gap

1220
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,600
between PCF and PCF
with effect handlers,

1221
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,400
due to the presence of first
class control in the latter.

1222
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,720
In this talk, I will not provide you

1223
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,000
with the actual proof of this.

1224
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,920
Instead, I'll aim to
give you the intuition

1225
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:57,360
for why this result is true.

1226
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,920
I will elaborate a bit
on the methodology.

1227
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,480
We impose one important rule,
namely that the type signature

1228
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,600
of generic count is fixed.

1229
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,920
That is no implementation in
PCF or PCF with effect handlers

1230
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,880
is allowed to change the type
signature of generic count.

1231
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,320
A consequence of this rule,
is that it's not possible

1232
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,680
to translate PCF with effect
handlers into PCF,

1233
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:22,200
say by way of an interpreter
or CPS translation.

1234
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,920
This way we really get to
study the essence of the power

1235
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:27,680
provided by effect
handlers. Moreover

1236
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:30,080
this rule is also reminiscent
of the restriction

1237
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,200
that programs are
faced by every day,

1238
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,920
when programming
against an interface.

1239
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,720
So we do consider this to
be a reasonable rule.

1240
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:39,440
With this in mind, let's look
at the following example predicate

1241
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,520
called EX and its
induced computation tree model.

1242
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,040
The predicate takes a point as input

1243
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,160
and applies this point to zero,

1244
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:50,160
or queries to see if
component has the point.

1245
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,960
This is reflected in the tree model,

1246
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:55,880
by the first interior node,
which reads question mark zero.

1247
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,200
I'm using the question
mark prefix here

1248
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:02,000
to denote invocations
or queries of points.

1249
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,520
And I'm using
exclamation mark prefix

1250
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:08,840
to denote answers or return
values of predicates.

1251
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:13,360
Now note how the structure
of the computation tree

1252
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,320
coincides with all
the possible control flows

1253
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,760
of the predicate.

1254
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:22,360
Let's consider a concrete
evaluation of this predicate.

1255
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:26,600
Supposed we apply to a point
whose zeroth component is true.

1256
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:31,840
First component is false,
and second component is true.

1257
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,040
Evaluation begins in the predicate,

1258
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:37,080
and eventually queries the
zeroth component of the point,

1259
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,520
which is true,

1260
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,840
meaning that we'll take
the left branch down the tree

1261
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,000
this corresponds to
continuing evaluation

1262
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,040
of the then branch in the predicate.

1263
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:50,240
Eventually, the predicate will
query the first component

1264
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,880
of the point, which is false,

1265
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,600
meaning we will take
the right branch down the tree,

1266
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,440
and then, at some
point, the predicate

1267
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:59,240
will query the second
component, which is true,

1268
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,520
meaning we take the left
branch down at the tree,

1269
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,320
and we now hit a leaf node
with the answer true,

1270
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,400
meaning that for this
particular point,

1271
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,520
the predicate will
yield the answer true.

1272
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:11,280
Now, this particular predicate
belongs to a certain class

1273
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:14,080
of predicates that admit
canonical models.

1274
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:17,880
We call such predicates N-standard.

1275
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:20,960
A tree model is N-standard
if it is a perfect binary tree

1276
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,760
of height N, in addition
we also require that

1277
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,400
the tree contains a query,

1278
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,200
and that no sub tree
repeats any query.

1279
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,840
We say that a predicate
is N standard

1280
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,760
if its model is N standard.

1281
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:35,960
For example, the predicate
EX is three standard.

1282
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,000
For the initial analysis,
we restrict our attention

1283
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,600
to N standard predicates.

1284
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,120
This restriction serves to
simplify the analysis,

1285
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,680
but it also provides us an instance

1286
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:44,680
where the efficiency gap

1287
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:47,040
between PCF and PCF
for the effect handles

1288
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,840
manifests as clearly as possible.

1289
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:50,840
This restriction will enable us

1290
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:53,480
to give a crisp implementation
of generic count

1291
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,320
with effect handles.

1292
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:57,720
OK, let's consider how
one might go about

1293
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:01,280
and implement generic
count with effect handles.

1294
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,640
First, we need to take
the predicate as input.

1295
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:06,920
And we have to apply this
predicate to a point.

1296
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:09,440
We represent this point
as the invocation

1297
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,320
of an abstract operation
called branch.

1298
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,120
The only thing we know about branch

1299
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:17,720
is that it's going to ultimately
return a Boolean value.

1300
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,800
And also, given
the interpretation of branch,

1301
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:23,000
we must wrap the entire
computation in a handler.

1302
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,800
A handler consists of two parts,

1303
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:27,360
a value clause that
tells it what to do

1304
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:30,800
with the return value
or the answer of a predicate.

1305
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,680
So if the answer is true, then
we're going to return one,

1306
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:37,160
and if the answer is false,
we're going to return zero.

1307
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,720
Then the second part is
an operation clause,

1308
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:42,200
specifically a clause for
the branch operation,

1309
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,120
which in addition to giving
access to the payload

1310
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,040
also gives access to
the continuation

1311
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:49,520
of the branch operation inside
the predicate computation.

1312
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,120
This is a first class entity,

1313
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:56,600
and what we do is we invoke
the continuation with true first,

1314
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:59,000
and then we invoke it
with false subsequently,

1315
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,240
and we sum up the result
of those two invocations.

1316
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:07,360
Now, let's consider concrete
evaluation of effcount

1317
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:10,320
applied to our example predicate.

1318
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,400
The first thing that
happens is the predicate

1319
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,920
queries the zeroth
component of the point.

1320
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:18,480
This query causes an invocation
of the branch operation.

1321
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,720
This invocation causes
control to transfer

1322
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:23,120
into the branch clause
in the handler

1323
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,200
where the first thing we do

1324
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:27,520
is we resume
the continuation with true,

1325
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:31,280
meaning that it is sent down to
the left branch in the tree.

1326
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,720
Now, when the predicate
queries the first component

1327
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:36,680
of the point, the very
same thing will happen.

1328
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:38,680
Another invocation of
branch will occur

1329
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:41,520
causing control to flow
into the branch clause

1330
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,440
in the handler where we resume
the continuation with true,

1331
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:48,960
so it is sent down
the left branch again.

1332
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,800
We repeat this same argument
when the predicate

1333
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,520
queries the second component,

1334
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,240
so it is sent down the left branch.

1335
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,960
Now, we find ourselves
ourselves at a leaf node,

1336
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,320
meaning that we invoke
the value clause in the handler

1337
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:07,080
with the answer false,
meaning that return a zero.

1338
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:09,280
At this stage, the handler
is going to backtrack

1339
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:10,720
to the most recent query

1340
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:14,040
and apply the continuation to false,

1341
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:17,120
taking us down the right
branch in the tree.

1342
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,240
Now we find ourself
again at the leaf node,

1343
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,840
so we're going to invoke
the value clause,

1344
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,880
but this time with the answer true,

1345
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,480
meaning that will return a one.

1346
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,840
The handle is now going
to sum up the answers

1347
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:31,840
that it got in the sub
tree, which is one.

1348
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:36,200
And then it's going to backtrack
to the most recent query,

1349
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,280
and then the pattern repeats.

1350
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:40,640
So it's going to resume to
continuation with false,

1351
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:44,480
and then subsequently with true.

1352
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,920
So, backtracking here

1353
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:49,480
ensures that every edge in the

1354
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:53,360
computation tree model it's
been visited exactly once.

1355
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:54,560
So if we generalize a bit.

1356
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,880
This means that computation involves

1357
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:02,240
Big O two to the N steps.

1358
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,160
Now, in PCF, we dont have effect handles.

1359
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:06,640
There's no mechanism
for backtracking

1360
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:08,560
for sharing computation.

1361
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,920
Therefore, every generic
counter function must restart

1362
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:13,120
computation for every point.

1363
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,560
Let me try to illustrate
what this means.

1364
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,480
Let's consider some generic
comm function

1365
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,840
applied to our example predicate,

1366
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,320
and let's for simplicity,

1367
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,480
assume that this
generic cunt function

1368
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,720
visits the notes in
the computation tree

1369
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:28,800
in depth first order.

1370
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,080
The first thing that happens is that

1371
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,600
the predicate queries the zeroth
component of the point,

1372
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,560
which returns true,

1373
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:38,320
meaning that'd be the sent down
the left branch in the tree.

1374
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,680
The same thing happens
for the first component

1375
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,680
and the second component.

1376
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:45,720
And so we find ourselves
at the first leaf.

1377
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:48,120
From here there is no
quick way to get to

1378
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:51,360
the second leaf, because
there is no backtracking

1379
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:54,400
on any means for sharing computation.

1380
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,160
So the generic count function
has to go all the way back up

1381
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:00,680
and construct a second point,
that represents the path

1382
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:03,720
to the second leaf, meaning
that we will have to repeat

1383
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,440
some work along the way,

1384
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:08,280
in order to finally
the arrive at the second leaf.

1385
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:10,120
And here the situation's the same.

1386
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:12,080
In order to get to the third leaf,

1387
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,760
we must go all the way back up,

1388
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:16,040
construct the third point
that represents the path

1389
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:19,760
to the third leaf, repeating
work along the way

1390
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:24,280
in order to finally arrive
at the third leaf.

1391
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,400
In general,
the generic count function

1392
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,160
will have to construct points

1393
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,480
in order to visit each of the leafs.

1394
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:33,440
This means that computation
involves, at least,

1395
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:36,520
two to the n steps.

1396
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:40,080
Some might object to PCF as
a choice of base language,

1397
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:41,640
because it lack characteristic
features found,

1398
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:44,480
in say, industrial
strength languages.

1399
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,920
However, as shown in the paper,

1400
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:50,200
the efficiency gap remains
even under extensions to PCF.

1401
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,520
Specifically, we consider
adding mutable static

1402
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,480
and exceptions into the picture,

1403
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,920
we consider them
separately and together,

1404
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:58,920
and I will claim that once
we've put them together

1405
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:01,400
our base language forms
a prototypical core,

1406
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:02,880
of an industrial strength language,

1407
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,080
like OCaml or Java.

1408
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:07,040
Furthermore, in
the paper we also discuss

1409
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,160
how to relax
the standard restriction.

1410
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:11,360
That is so the predicate models

1411
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:14,000
no longer needs to be
perfect binary trees,

1412
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,880
and we can account
for repeat queries

1413
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,920
and we don't even need to
query all the components

1414
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,000
of a point.

1415
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,600
We also consider how to extend
the problem to search,

1416
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,840
that is, instead of returning
the number of times,

1417
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:28,880
this predicate will
satisfy return to points

1418
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,840
that satisfy the predicate.

1419
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,880
We showed that the same
 asymptotic bound applies

1420
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:35,600
to the search problem.

1421
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,960
We also conducted
empirical evaluation.

1422
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:44,680
In summary, the takeaway is
that control operators admit,

1423
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,560
asymptotically more
efficient implementations

1424
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,560
of some programs,

1425
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,080
and the intuition
for why that is true

1426
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,720
is because control operators
enable computation

1427
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:55,040
to be shared while backtracking.

1428
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,000
And as for future work, we
would like to consider

1429
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,200
how linear handles fits
into the picture.

1430
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,560
So linear handles are
a special form of handlers

1431
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:06,640
that only allow the continuation
to have been booked once.

1432
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:09,080
It is not clear that our
current proof techniques

1433
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:10,480
will adapt vertically
to the situation,

1434
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:11,760
with the new handlers.

1435
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:14,160
So, it would be interesting
to investigate.

1436
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:15,920
Another thing that would be
interesting to investigate

1437
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:16,920
would be a richer type system.

1438
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,640
Say, one of the features
effect-typing,

1439
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:21,240
and how that would
impact the result.

called "Computation Focusing,"

by myself, and my advisor,
Steve Zdancewic,

1459
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:24,680
at the University of Pennsylvania.

1460
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:27,120
Our paper is all about
proving program equivalents.

1461
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:30,200
This is an important way
of reasoning about them.

1462
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:31,720
So, whether you have a compiler

1463
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:33,440
that performs CPS translations,

1464
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:36,280
or just some optimizer that
does function inlining,

1465
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:37,720
in order to justify them,

1466
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:38,720
you're probably going to want

1467
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,720
to be able to prove
programs equivalent.

1468
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:44,200
The, sort of, gold
standard of equivalence,

1469
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,160
the notion that we care most about,

1470
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:47,760
is called contextual equivalence.

1471
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:50,000
And two programs are
contextually equivalent

1472
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,440
when they show the same
behavior in all contexts,

1473
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:55,200
there's no way to
distinguish between them.

1474
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,360
But proving this is difficult

1475
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:58,440
because there's so many
different possible contexts

1476
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:00,160
that programs could be used in

1477
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:06,280
that we can't really just do
a case analysis on all of them.

1478
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:08,320
So we need other techniques
to prove equivalences

1479
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:10,040
and the CIU theorem does this.

1480
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,200
It allows us to,

1481
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:15,040
rather than consider all
possible general contexts,

1482
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,160
only look at evaluation contexts

1483
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:20,280
paired with closing substitutions,

1484
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:22,160
but there are still
difficulties here.

1485
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:23,800
And in particular in call by value,

1486
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:25,960
there's still many possible
evaluation contexts.

1487
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,160
So it's difficult to reason
about the interaction

1488
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,880
between a term and its context

1489
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:33,640
and call by name has this
very similar dual problem.

1490
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:36,120
So another class of
syntactic proof techniques

1491
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:39,040
includes logical relations
and bisimulations.

1492
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,440
Logical relations in particular,

1493
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,320
give you a really nice high
level reasoning principles

1494
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:45,200
like relational parametricity,

1495
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:47,040
but there are still
some limitations.

1496
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:51,240
And one of those limitations
is that some equivalences

1497
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:55,200
between existential types
have not been easy to prove

1498
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:58,640
in the past using logical relations.

1499
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:01,520
And the problem is essentially
that logical relations

1500
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,120
are just more natural to use

1501
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:07,560
to reason about how
a program produces an output,

1502
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:11,440
than how it uses its input.

1503
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,600
So let's look at a particular value

1504
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:16,920
of this existential type.

1505
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:20,280
And let's look at how these
values of this type are used.

1506
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,720
Well, we used existential types
by pattern matching on them

1507
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:23,720
to unpack them.

1508
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:27,760
And here we unpack this
existential into a function Y

1509
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:29,280
and this Y is a high order function.

1510
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:32,320
So we pass another function
F as input into it.

1511
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:35,560
And F has the type X arrow X,

1512
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:39,240
but this X type is an abstract type.

1513
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:41,960
And so F must be
the identity function.

1514
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:44,080
So with that in mind, let's
look at these two values

1515
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,280
of the same existential type.

1516
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:49,480
They contain functions
that themselves

1517
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:51,920
take another function as input F

1518
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:55,680
and they both apply F to
many different values,

1519
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:58,400
checking to see that it does indeed

1520
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,840
behave as the identity function.

1521
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:04,000
Since we've already
shown that this is true,

1522
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,160
we can look at
the functions in these packages

1523
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:10,160
and confirm that they both are
always going to return true,

1524
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:12,320
no matter what.

1525
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:15,520
So, in other words, this means
that they must be equivalent.

1526
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:17,200
But logical relations
in bisimulations

1527
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,520
struggle to prove this
because they force you

1528
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:22,600
to come up with some relational
interpretation for X

1529
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:26,000
that somehow relates
values of Boolean type

1530
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,040
to values of Integer type.

1531
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:31,080
But we have no such
relation in mind here.

1532
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:36,720
There's not really a correspondence
between the values of X

1533
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:37,720
in one of these packages

1534
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:40,520
with values of X in
the other package.

1535
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:42,320
So instead, what we want to do

1536
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:45,680
is look at the possible context
these values may be used in

1537
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:48,640
and exploit the fact that
they're constrained

1538
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:50,480
by their types.

1539
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:51,760
So throughout the rest of the talk,

1540
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:54,440
we're going to look at
a proof theoretic technique

1541
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:57,000
called focusing and show
that that's actually useful

1542
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,640
for reasoning about programs.

1543
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:02,240
In fact, we can use that to
prove this equivalence.

1544
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:04,800
Lastly, we'll see why this
technique might be useful

1545
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,920
in compositional
compiler correctness.

1546
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:08,480
For this talk, we're
gonna deal with

1547
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:11,360
a call by value language
with predicative polymorphism

1548
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:12,360
in a pure setting,

1549
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:15,600
but the paper goes beyond
some of these restrictions.

1550
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:16,880
So what is focusing?

1551
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,320
Well, focusing is
a proof search technique

1552
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:21,400
that narrows down the search space

1553
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:24,000
when you're trying to find
a proof of a certain proposition.

1554
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,640
And viewed through
the lens of Curry Howard,

1555
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:27,560
you can think of it as
making things easier

1556
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:30,000
when you're trying to synthesize
a program of a given.

1557
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:32,520
So how does focusing
narrow down the search space?

1558
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:35,880
Well, it does that by visiting
fewer redundant terms

1559
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:40,800
that are just equivalent to each
other via beta or eta laws.

1560
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:43,280
We don't have time to go into
focusing in depth today

1561
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,840
but I wanted to give you a flavor

1562
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:47,760
of what focused terms look like.

1563
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:50,600
So let's try and visit
all the focused programs

1564
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:53,960
of Boolean to Boolean type.

1565
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:56,160
The first thing that
focusing says we can do

1566
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:58,600
is apply the lambda type constructor

1567
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:01,240
anytime we have a function
on the right hand side.

1568
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:04,400
So that just any term in our
language of function type

1569
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,680
is going to be equivalent
to sum lambda.

1570
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:09,440
And that's true by
eta in call by name

1571
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,920
and in call by value we're
also using normalization.

1572
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,960
But if you didn't have normalization

1573
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:15,720
you could still use this technique

1574
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:20,360
you would just have an extra non-terminating
term to consider.

1575
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:21,840
So now we need to consider

1576
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:24,200
what the body of
the lambda might be.

1577
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:26,000
And when we're trying to build that

1578
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,160
focusing says that
the first thing we can do

1579
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:29,760
is eagerly pattern match.

1580
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,520
Anytime there's
something in the context

1581
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,240
that can be pattern matched on

1582
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:34,440
focusing says we might as well

1583
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,040
do that pattern matching right now,

1584
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:38,440
there's no point
waiting until later.

1585
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:41,120
So now we know that all
the terms we're interested in

1586
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,880
have a lambda on the outside

1587
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,680
and then immediately pattern
match on it's input.

1588
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:48,800
And what we're left to
build are the two branches

1589
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:49,800
of the if statement.

1590
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:50,800
Both of these are closed

1591
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,560
because focusing knows
that there's no point

1592
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:56,240
in pattern matching on x twice
once we've already done it.

1593
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:58,920
And so we just need to
build focused programs

1594
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:00,000
of Boolean type.

1595
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
And it turns out there
are only two of those,

1596
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,600
true and false.

1597
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,360
And so we can use those to build

1598
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:07,160
our four candidate programs here

1599
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:09,880
and turns out that every function
of Boolean to Boolean type

1600
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:11,880
needs to be equivalent to

1601
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:14,040
one of these four focused programs.

1602
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:16,280
We've cut out many, many
non-focused programs

1603
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:19,480
such as the identity
function lambda x.x

1604
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:21,080
but this program is
still represented

1605
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:25,160
in the second bullet point here.

1606
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:28,120
So some properties of focused
terms to keep in mind

1607
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:30,600
are that focused terms are
always beta eta normal.

1608
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,520
There's no way to beta reduce them

1609
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:37,680
and they can't be eta expanded
without introducing a redex.

1610
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:40,960
And we characterize
them in our paper

1611
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:43,080
as a restricted type system.

1612
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:46,200
Basically, the usual type
rules that you're used to

1613
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:49,200
but restricted to be
applied in a certain order

1614
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:51,040
and this gives you strong
inversion principles

1615
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:54,600
to do programmatic reasoning.

1616
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:57,000
Lastly, for every focused term,

1617
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,320
for every well typed term,

1618
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,280
there's some equivalent
focused term.

1619
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:02,280
This is called
computational completeness

1620
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,840
and it's the key property we need

1621
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,520
for reasoning about programs

1622
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,160
and basically all it says is that

1623
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:10,880
we may have eliminated many
redundant representations

1624
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,640
of the same program but we
haven't lost anything of value,

1625
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:16,200
there's still some
representative focus program

1626
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:18,800
for any other program.

1627
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:21,440
So why are we talking about
a proof search technique

1628
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:24,320
in a talk about
contextual equivalence?

1629
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:27,560
Well, it turns out that a proof
of contextual equivalence

1630
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:31,120
is just a search through
all possible contexts

1631
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:34,160
demonstrating the same
behavior for each context.

1632
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:35,680
And so if you think
about it like this

1633
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,640
and you apply
the completeness of focusing

1634
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:40,280
then you can see that
there's no need

1635
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:42,080
to search through all
possible contexts,

1636
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:46,200
you only need to search
through focused contexts.

1637
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:48,280
So that leads us to
a context dilemma

1638
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:49,360
which looks a little hairy

1639
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:50,920
but all this is saying is that

1640
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:52,920
to prove two values equivalent

1641
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:55,760
you only need to consider
focused contexts

1642
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:58,280
which are represented
by a term, an f,

1643
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:01,800
with a whole x represented
as a variable here.

1644
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:05,400
And if v1 and v2 are open then
you need to close them off

1645
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:07,160
with some closing substitutions

1646
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:09,080
but you can assume
that all the values

1647
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:13,040
in those substitutions are focused.

1648
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:14,400
So let's return to the equivalence

1649
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,080
that we wanted to prove earlier.

1650
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:18,720
And now we'll apply
our focusing loma.

1651
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:21,960
And this context loma says,
since these values are closed,

1652
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:23,920
we just need to consider
some context NF

1653
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:26,120
and show that they
both behave the same

1654
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:31,520
when the values are filled in for X.

1655
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:36,360
So what does the fact that
NF is focused tell us?

1656
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:41,680
Well the whole in NF X
has existential type,

1657
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:42,880
and we know that existential types

1658
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,280
can be pattern matched on.

1659
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:47,920
So focusing says let's
do that right away.

1660
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:50,240
Now once we unpack the existential,

1661
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:52,200
we get this function Y,

1662
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:55,280
and the rest of the body
of the pattern

1663
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:58,280
after each statement gets to
call Y potentially.

1664
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,960
So there's really only two
things that we can do here,

1665
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:02,880
either we call Y or we
don't, and if we don't,

1666
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:07,360
then we can only return
a constant bullion value.

1667
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:09,120
So there are three possible shapes

1668
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:12,560
of programs here that
this context may take.

1669
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,480
We need to show that the two values

1670
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:15,560
behave the same in each of them.

1671
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:18,680
This is easy in the case
of the constant bullion

1672
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:23,480
because the context just
ignores its input.

1673
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,880
The interesting case
is when we call Y.

1674
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:28,360
And what happens here
is that V1

1675
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:31,720
is going to get destructed
and substituted in for Y.

1676
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,760
And it's gonna get passed in F,

1677
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:34,760
which we've talked about before

1678
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:36,600
must be the identity function.

1679
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,520
So if you plug
the identity function into

1680
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:41,720
the functions in V1
and V2, and you reduce,

1681
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:45,000
you can see that both
of them return true.

1682
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:51,440
So what's left in
the proof is to show that Z

1683
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:54,240
is equal to true in both cases.

1684
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:57,800
And that, combined with
a small detail

1685
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:00,000
about the proof structure
that you can see

1686
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,240
in the paper, let us
complete this proof.

1687
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:05,080
Now that we've seen
program equivalence,

1688
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:07,520
let's look at compiler correctness.

1689
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:09,600
One property you might
want about your compiler

1690
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:13,400
is that it preserves
all of the abstractions

1691
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:14,840
in the source language.

1692
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,680
So to say this more
precisely,

1693
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:22,160
you can say that two terms in the source
language are equivalent

1694
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:24,720
implies that after you compile them,

1695
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,920
they should still be equivalent.

1696
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:28,400
To prove this, you need to consider

1697
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:32,680
an arbitrary source target
language context, C prime,

1698
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:36,440
but we have a source language
equivalence to use.

1699
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:38,840
So we need to back translate
the target context

1700
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:42,280
C prime to a source
language equivalence.

1701
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:46,120
And the key idea that
focusing helps us with here

1702
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:48,120
is that we don't need
to back translate

1703
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:50,000
every single possible
target context,

1704
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,160
we only need the back
translate the focused ones.

1705
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:57,160
There's a long history of using
focusing in proof theory,

1706
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:59,360
but there's also a related
work here that uses

1707
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:02,200
focusing in the context of
programming languages.

1708
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:05,520
Especially as a guide to design

1709
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:08,040
features of programming languages.

1710
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:10,000
There's also work that uses focusing

1711
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,840
as a normalization
procedure to decide the equivalence of terms

1712
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:15,920
in the simply typed lambda calculus.

1713
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,920
Lastly, normalization by evaluation

1714
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:19,880
is pretty relevant
because it could be used

1715
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:23,640
to prove our completeness
of focusing theorem.

1716
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:25,240
There are many different
types system features

1717
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:28,440
and effects that we might
study, and we expect

1718
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:33,840
focusing to be a useful tool
along with all of these.

1719
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:37,080
In particular,
the combination of linearity

1720
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:39,200
and focusing is really
interesting to study

1721
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:40,960
because that's where
focusing originated

1722
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:43,960
and because linear
lambda calculus terms

1723
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:45,680
have very nice normal forms

1724
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:48,600
that make them easy to reason about.

1725
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:52,160
To recap, our paper
contributes a few things.

1726
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:54,080
First, we formulate focusing

1727
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:57,480
in a call by value language
with predicative polymorphism.

1728
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:58,520
And we provide a proof

1729
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:01,360
of the computational
completeness there.

1730
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:03,960
Then we prove a context lemma

1731
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:06,160
and show that that's useful in turn

1732
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:08,160
to prove various
programming equivalencies

1733
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:10,480
like the one we saw today.

1734
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:12,680
Finally, we showed that
focusing can be used

1735
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:15,760
to prove compositional compiler
correctness properties,

1736
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:17,280
like full obstruction.

1737
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:19,320
And when we do this
for a simple compiler

1738
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:22,480
from a language that's
pure into a language

1739
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:24,200
with a simple divergence effect,

1740
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:27,400
that's tracked by an effect system.

1741
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:29,280
That's all for focusing for now.

1742
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,640
Thank you.

(MUSIC FADES)

1753
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:05,880
So, welcome back to
the second session of ICFP 2020,

1754
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:07,840
and our next paper is going to be

1755
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:11,000
"Retrofitting
Parallelism into OCaml."

1756
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:17,080
And it's been presented
by KC Sivaramakrishnan.

1757
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:20,520
KC: Hi, I'm KC and I'm going
to present our work on

1758
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:23,720
retrofitting parallelism into OCaml.

1759
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:26,560
So OCaml is a reasonably
popular programming language

1760
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:29,120
that is used by several,
multiple industries,

1761
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:31,560
but also widely in the academia.

1762
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:33,080
Vocab and language has particularly

1763
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:36,960
found favor for implementing

1764
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,400
software verification
and static analysis tools

1765
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:43,240
and also low-latency system services

1766
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:44,880
and for all of its strengths

1767
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:49,640
OCaml is one of the few
systems programming languages

1768
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:53,960
that lacks support for multi-core.

1769
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:57,040
To that end multi-core
OCaml is an ongoing project

1770
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:58,320
which aims to add native support

1771
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:03,080
for concurrency
and parallelism in OCaml.

1772
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:05,960
Concurrency in multi-core
OCaml is added

1773
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:08,080
with the help of effect handlers,

1774
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:11,040
but the focus of this
particular talk is going to be

1775
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:14,680
on parallelism and in
particular, we are going to

1776
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:17,200
look at the details of
a multi-core capable

1777
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:21,120
garbage collector that we have
in (INAUDIBLE) types of OCaml.

1778
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:24,440
The design space for
multi-core OCaml,

1779
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:28,400
multi-core garbage
collectors is quite wide.

1780
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:31,360
And what makes our
work unique is that

1781
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:36,400
our design is guided by
backwards compatibility concerns

1782
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:40,120
before parallel scalability.

1783
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:44,720
So adding parallelism to
OCaml has several challenges.

1784
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:47,720
OCaml has millions of lines
of code in production

1785
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:52,400
that have been written without
explicit parallelism in mind.

1786
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:55,160
And this core tends to also
use advanced features

1787
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:57,720
such as weak references,
ephemerons, lazy values

1788
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:59,920
and finalizers, which
closely interact

1789
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:02,960
with the current GC.

1790
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:06,280
OCaml also exposes
a low level of C API

1791
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:09,480
that allows the developers to
write very efficient code,

1792
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:12,320
but also bakes in the GC ingredients

1793
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:15,560
and the cost of refactoring
sequential code

1794
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:17,680
in order to work on
a parallel run-time

1795
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:18,920
is quite prohibitive.

1796
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:24,160
So that is not something
that we would want to do.

1797
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:26,680
OCaml is also a type-safe language.

1798
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:30,280
The additional parallelism
should break type-safety.

1799
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:32,680
For this, we directly
borrow the memory model

1800
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:36,160
that was presented
in the PLD 2018 paper,

1801
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:38,520
Bounding databases
in space and time,

1802
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:41,320
which guarantees not
just type-safety,

1803
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:46,000
but also other strong
properties under databases.

1804
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,760
Developers using OCaml have
come to love and embrace

1805
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:53,440
the low latency and predictable
performance of OCaml.

1806
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:56,680
And this is thanks to the GC design.

1807
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:58,400
Stock OCaml garbage collector

1808
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:02,040
is a non-moving incremental
mark-and-sweep GC

1809
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:06,520
where new objects are allocated
into a small minor heap

1810
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:09,000
by bump pointer allocation
and survivors are copied

1811
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,480
to the major heap.

1812
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:12,280
The major heap is collected
with the incremental

1813
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:14,960
non-moving
mark-and-sweep collector.

1814
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:17,800
At the start of a major cycle
there is a small idle phase

1815
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:20,520
after which the roots are
incrementally marked,

1816
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:23,240
followed by incrementally
marking the rest of the heap.

1817
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:24,720
And once the marking is done,

1818
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:27,400
any unreachable objects
are incrementally swept.

1819
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:28,400
And at the end of sweeping,

1820
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:31,400
we come to the end
of our major cycle.

1821
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:34,560
This design has several
nice properties.

1822
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:35,960
The allocations into the minor heap,

1823
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:38,080
which are majority of
allocations are quite fast,

1824
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:40,240
and we do not have any read barriers

1825
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:43,760
for reading OCaml object fields.

1826
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:46,320
And this design being
incremental

1827
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:51,120
also leads to enviable tail
latency performance.

1828
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:53,400
And while we add parallelism
to this language,

1829
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:56,640
we would like to keep some
of these nice properties

1830
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:58,880
still going.

1831
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:00,640
So we arrive at these
following requirements

1832
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:04,480
for retrofitting
parallelism onto OCaml.

1833
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:06,640
Firstly, we don't want
serial programs to break on

1834
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:08,200
the parallel runtime.

1835
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:09,680
A well typed serial program
remains well typed

1836
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:11,520
on the parallel runtime.

1837
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:15,440
And we also do not plan to
provide separate modes

1838
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:17,720
for serial and parallel
execution

1839
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:20,760
as Glasgow Haskell Compiler does.

1840
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:23,440
This is because we want to reduce
the burden of maintenance

1841
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:26,160
on the OCaml developers.

1842
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:27,680
Secondly, we want the performance of

1843
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:29,720
CDL programs to be the same,

1844
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:32,000
wile running on the battle
runtime in terms of

1845
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,480
the running time GC for
stains and memory usage.

1846
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:38,480
And lastly, we want our battle programs
to remain responsive.

1847
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:41,360
And then we want
the pilot programs to be able

1848
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:43,360
to scale the traditional course.

1849
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:46,120
We ordered the priorities this way

1850
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:48,920
because getting responsiveness
is much harder

1851
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:52,240
than making our programs go faster.

1852
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:54,640
So with that, we
designed a multicolor

1853
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:56,840
OCaml garbage collector.

1854
01:47:57,680 --> 01:47:59,800
And our multicolor red
allocator is based

1855
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:02,200
on the screen Flow allocator,

1856
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:04,400
which uses thread local
size segment of tree lists

1857
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:07,280
for small objects
and resorts two system alleys

1858
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:09,000
for large allocation.

1859
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,920
And the performance of
this allocator is better

1860
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:15,360
than OCaml first expert allocator

1861
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:18,000
and is on par with the recent

1862
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:21,160
best-fit allocator from OCaml.

1863
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:25,440
And the major heap is
collected with the

1864
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:27,600
mostly concurrent non-moving
mark and sweep collector,

1865
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,920
based on the VCDC design.

1866
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:32,600
One nice aspect of this
design is that we only need

1867
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:38,480
a very short barrier at
the end of every major cycle.

1868
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:39,760
And I should, at this point mention

1869
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:43,400
that domains are our
units of adolescence.

1870
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:45,680
And in particular, there
is no phase separation

1871
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:46,720
between marking and sweeping

1872
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:49,560
and marking and sweeping phases

1873
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:52,600
between multiple
domains may overlap.

1874
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:55,360
One of the major contributions
in this paper is

1875
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:57,560
extending this design
to support a variety

1876
01:48:57,560 --> 01:49:02,400
of additional features such as
weak references, ephemeron,

1877
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:06,600
two different kinds of
finalisers, fibers lazy values

1878
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:08,840
and so on.

1879
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:12,000
Ephemerons are particularly
tricky to get efficiently

1880
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,800
implemented in
the concurrent multi-core GC.

1881
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:17,760
Ephemerons themselves are
generalization of weak references,

1882
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:19,760
and the property that
they bring in is,

1883
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:21,920
they introduce conjunction in
the reachability property

1884
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:25,760
of OCaml in for objects in the heap

1885
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:28,960
And this requires multiple
rounds of ephemeron marking

1886
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:33,520
and also marking the heap in
order to reach a fixed point.

1887
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:36,600
And in this work,
what we've shown is

1888
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:41,360
we can implement a cycle
delimited handshaking algorithm

1889
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:44,160
in order to perform
the ephemeron marking,

1890
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:48,560
without requiring a global barrier.

1891
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:50,440
The two different kinds
of finaliser in Ocaml

1892
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:54,840
also need two barriers,
one barrier each.

1893
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:57,720
And in the worst case, we need
the three barriers per cycle,

1894
01:49:57,720 --> 01:49:59,960
a major cycle.

1895
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:02,400
And because this design
is quite tricky,

1896
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:07,040
we verify the model of
this design (INAUDIBLE)

1897
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:12,960
Next, we come to the issue of
what to do about minor GCs.

1898
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:17,800
Our initial design was based
on a knowledge of 93 collector,

1899
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:20,360
which uses a minor heap domain,

1900
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:22,320
but it's a lazier on the line,

1901
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:27,400
serves the GC collector from
Marlow and Peyton Jones, 2011.

1902
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:31,880
So this particular
design has an invariant

1903
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:36,080
that there are no pointers
between two minor heaps.

1904
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:37,440
And this allows each domain

1905
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:41,320
to be independently
garbage collected.

1906
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:45,320
And unlike the original
Dialogue lever design,

1907
01:50:45,320 --> 01:50:49,160
we are low pointers from
the major to the minor heap.

1908
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:51,720
And the reason why we
allow this is two fold.

1909
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:55,920
First, it prevents
eager promotion, right?

1910
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:58,280
So early promotion is
a problem where you point

1911
01:50:58,280 --> 01:51:00,000
to an object, which is promoted,

1912
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:02,760
which would
otherwise have not been.

1913
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:05,840
If you hadn't
established this pointer

1914
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:08,320
and this also mirrors
sequential behaviour

1915
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:11,840
and unfortunately, what this does is

1916
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:14,800
a particular domain
may follow a pointer

1917
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,520
from the major to the minor heap

1918
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:18,440
to remote minor heap.

1919
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:21,480
And this will break
the invariant that we had.

1920
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,600
So, what we need to do is
insert a read barrier

1921
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:27,280
on reading OCaml object fields

1922
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:31,000
which detects whether the result
of the read is going to be

1923
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,920
a value and a remote minor heap

1924
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:36,760
in which case, the domain
sensor interdomain entrap

1925
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:39,520
requesting the target domain
to come out the object

1926
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,880
which in turn might perform

1927
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:44,240
a local minor garbage collection.

1928
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:47,160
And then, the execution proceeds.

1929
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:53,920
Recall that I had mentioned that
OCaml does not have read barriers

1930
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:56,360
and now, this design has
interviews read barriers.

1931
01:51:56,360 --> 01:51:59,520
So, the first challenge is that we
need these read barriers to be

1932
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:02,760
implemented efficiently for
performance backwards compatibility.

1933
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:06,240
And in the paper, we showed
that we can do this

1934
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:09,160
but the clever vector of
virtual memory mapping and

1935
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:11,680
a series of bit-twiddling tricks,

1936
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:15,080
using which, we have brought
down the read barrier to

1937
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:16,720
three (INAUDIBLE) instructions.

1938
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:19,840
And the proof of correctness of
this is available in the paper.

1939
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:21,640
And the...

1940
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:23,840
Because this

1941
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:26,200
(INAUDIBLE) are going to be sorted.

1942
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:28,520
The branch corrector correctly
predicts the branch

1943
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:30,600
almost every read.

1944
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:32,880
So, the performance impact of

1945
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:35,520
these additional instructions is
minimal on sequential code.

1946
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:39,600
Unfortunately though,
the introduction of the read barriers

1947
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:41,000
breaks the C API.

1948
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:43,800
And check out this example where

1949
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:46,800
we have two domains, each
of which is reading

1950
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:50,680
a major heap object which
points to the other domain.

1951
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:53,280
So, at this point, this domain

1952
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:58,120
sends a promotion request
to the other domain.

1953
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,840
So, the two domains simultaneously
send promotion requests

1954
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:03,760
and in order to prevent that
lock and make progress,

1955
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:06,280
when the domain sends
a promotion request,

1956
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:09,000
it has to keep servicing
other promotion requests

1957
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,560
that it may receive.

1958
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:15,240
So, the issue is that because
promotion may involve

1959
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:18,480
a minor collection,

1960
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:23,080
a mutable read is in fact a GC
safe point where GC may happen.

1961
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:26,440
But this

1962
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:29,360
breaks the (INAUDIBLE) that

1963
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:31,440
we haven't stored OCaml well.

1964
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:33,160
We don't have any
read barriers at all

1965
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:36,480
and in particular, the C API
is often explicitly written

1966
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:38,760
with the knowledge of
when the GC may happen.

1967
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:40,840
And introducing

1968
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:44,920
a read barrier, where the read
barrier is a GC safe point

1969
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:50,080
will require manually
refactoring very tricky code.

1970
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:54,520
And this is unfortunate.

1971
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:56,440
So, in order to

1972
01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:00,920
get around this, we also implement
the parallel minor collector

1973
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:03,440
which does stop-the-world
parallel minor collection

1974
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:06,080
similar to GHCs minor collection.

1975
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:08,160
So, this shows

1976
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:11,440
a timeline of
the concurring minor collector

1977
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:12,800
where we have two domains

1978
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:14,600
and the minor collections
here can order

1979
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:17,200
what are the activities being
done on the other domains.

1980
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:19,960
And in particular, we read a barrier

1981
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:22,800
once per major cycle

1982
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:25,960
whereas in the parallel
minor collector, we read

1983
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:27,600
barrier

1984
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:29,800
two barriers for every
minor collection

1985
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:31,720
in order to indicate
the start and end.

1986
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:34,960
And these minor collections
are very frequent

1987
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:36,800
and

1988
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:39,040
in order to better utilize

1989
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:41,720
idle time

1990
01:54:42,120 --> 01:54:43,720
while we are waiting for

1991
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:45,600
the minor collections to complete

1992
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:48,560
and when a particular domain has
completed its minor collection

1993
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:50,880
but it's waiting for other domains
to complete the minor collections,

1994
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:53,000
we fill this (INAUDIBLE)
space in the

1995
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:57,360
in the barrier with major slices.

1996
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:02,440
The advantage of this design is that
we don't read barriers anymore.

1997
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:06,920
But our global barriers
are quite frequent now.

1998
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:11,000
So, we need to be able to quickly
bring all of the domains to a stop.

1999
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:15,080
So, we insert poll points in our
code for timely interrupt handling.

2000
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:19,120
And this is based on
Feeley's paper from 93.

2001
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:22,680
So, the big question is
how does this perform?

2002
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:24,800
So, we perform evaluation on a

2003
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:27,680
U circuit 14 quad Intel
Xeon on a Gold CPU

2004
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:30,320
where we've isolated 24 cores
for performance evaluation.

2005
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:36,080
And we observe that the sequential
throughput is comparable to OCaml.

2006
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:38,240
The... Compared to stock Ocaml

2007
01:55:38,240 --> 01:55:42,960
Concurrent Minor was 4.9% slower
and Parallel Minor was 3.5% slower.

2008
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:45,080
These overheads are quite reasonable

2009
01:55:45,080 --> 01:55:48,320
and the reason why Concurrent Minor
is slower then Parallel Minor is

2010
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:51,000
that the additional instructions
for read barriers.

2011
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:55,720
But we also observed that both
Concurrent Minor and Parallel Minor

2012
01:55:55,720 --> 01:55:58,240
used much lower peak memory

2013
01:55:58,240 --> 01:55:59,960
than stock OCaml.

2014
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:01,680
This is because our

2015
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:06,400
allocator is much more efficient
introducing fragmentation.

2016
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:08,680
So, this gives us promise that

2017
01:56:08,680 --> 01:56:11,880
we can relax the memory bounds
in order to get better

2018
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:13,680
running times.

2019
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:18,440
And we also observed that our
sequential GC pause times

2020
01:56:18,440 --> 01:56:20,520
are on par with OCaml.

2021
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:23,360
These results and more details
are available on the paper.

2022
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:26,360
Next, we look at
parallel scalability.

2023
01:56:26,720 --> 01:56:28,680
The graphs here show
that the scalability...

2024
01:56:28,680 --> 01:56:30,760
The speed up of each
of the benchmarks

2025
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:34,400
with respect to sequential baseline.

2026
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:39,760
Overall, we see that the two
variants perform similarly

2027
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:41,640
except a few notable differences.

2028
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:43,800
On a few benchmarks,

2029
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:46,280
Concurrent Minor really
suffers due to read faults

2030
01:56:46,280 --> 01:56:48,600
where just performing
a read requires

2031
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:52,560
sending an (INAUDIBLE), requesting
the other domain to promote,

2032
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:54,560
that domain promotes while

2033
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:57,080
the domain with read folder is

2034
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:58,760
idly waiting.

2035
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:02,640
And we also see other cases
where the unbalanced allocation

2036
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:05,640
leads to inopportune minor
GCs in Parallel Minor

2037
01:57:06,120 --> 01:57:09,000
which causes scalability issues.

2038
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:13,480
We also observed that the parallel
GC latency was roughly similar

2039
01:57:13,480 --> 01:57:15,400
between Parallel Minor
and Concurrent Minor.

2040
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:17,560
And (INAUDIBLE) means

2041
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:19,680
Parallel Minor wins
over Concurrent Minor

2042
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:21,880
because firstly, it
doesn't break the C API.

2043
01:57:21,880 --> 01:57:24,680
And it performs almost
similarly up to 24 cores.

2044
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:30,000
And OCaml 5.00 which will
have multicore support

2045
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:31,640
will use Parallel Minor.

2046
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:33,400
We may reuse the Concurrent
Minor later for

2047
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:35,040
a time when

2048
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:37,920
commodity machines will have lot of

2049
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:40,040
lot of codes than

2050
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:42,400
they do now.

2051
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:44,960
I'll stop here. Thank you.

2052
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:50,880
(AUDIENCE CLAPS)

2053
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,320
ALAN JEFFREY: So, thank you KC.

2054
01:57:55,320 --> 01:57:58,240
And if you wanna join the authors

2055
01:57:58,240 --> 01:58:00,360
for a live Q&A,

2056
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:02,560
click on the link in Clowdr.

2057
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:13,480
Hello and welcome back to
the second session for ICFP 2020.

2058
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:17,160
And the last paper in this
session is going to be

2059
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:18,920
liquid information flow control

2060
01:58:18,920 --> 01:58:23,920
and it's gonna be presented  by
Jean Yang and Nadia Polikarpova.

2061
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:31,680
JEAN YANG: If you're
the director of the FBI,

2062
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:35,080
you should be able to keep your
social media accounts on lockdown,

2063
01:58:35,080 --> 01:58:37,280
but this turned out
not to be the case

2064
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:40,440
for former FBI Director James Comey.

2065
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:43,000
Journalist Ashley
Feinberg discovered

2066
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,880
Comey's secret Instagram and Twitter

2067
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:50,520
simply by sending a follow request
to Comey's sons private Instagram.

2068
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:51,760
The culprit,

2069
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:55,080
a leak in Instagram's
suggestions algorithm.

2070
01:58:55,400 --> 01:58:58,520
This kind of thing affects many
more of us than just the Comeys

2071
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:01,720
and it happens more
and more everyday.

2072
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:03,840
NADIA POLIKARPOVA: Today's software

2073
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:05,920
handles lot of sensitive information

2074
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:08,640
subject to complex
security policies.

2075
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:11,600
Traditionally, programmers
enforce these policies

2076
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:15,480
by string policy enforcing
code or policy checks

2077
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:17,280
throughout the application.

2078
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,040
It is all too easy to
miss a chat by mistake

2079
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:23,720
causing a potential
information leak.

2080
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:28,560
A much better approach is to let
programmers specify policies

2081
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:31,760
declaratively and separately
from the application code.

2082
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:35,440
And then, let an information
flow control framework

2083
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:39,000
ensure that the code
satisfies these policies.

2084
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:43,440
IFC frameworks come in two
flavors - static and dynamic

2085
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:46,520
which have complementary
strengths and weakenesses.

2086
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:49,840
In this work, we will
focus on static techniques

2087
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:54,480
which ensure absence of leaks
once and for all a compile time,

2088
01:59:54,560 --> 02:00:00,640
hence avoiding surprise failures
and performance overhead at runtime.

2089
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:05,640
On the flipside, existing static
techniques are enabled to handle

2090
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:09,440
rich policies that modern
applications need

2091
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:14,200
or if they can, they require
programmers to provide proof hints

2092
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:16,800
to verify absence of leaks.

2093
02:00:17,880 --> 02:00:22,320
In this work, we developed
a new IFC framework called Lifty

2094
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:25,280
short for Liquid
Information Flow Types

2095
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:29,320
which combines the best of
static and dynamic techniques.

2096
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:34,560
Lifty is a static framework
but unlike existing static solutions,

2097
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:39,560
it is able to verify rich security
policies completely automatically.

2098
02:00:40,760 --> 02:00:43,360
To enable this
automatic verification,

2099
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:47,160
our first contribution
is an encoding of IFC

2100
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:50,840
into a decidable type system
based on liquid types,

2101
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:52,720
hence the name.

2102
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:56,080
Moreover, when the application code
does not satisfy the policies,

2103
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:59,280
Lifty can automatically
generate leak patches

2104
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:01,840
that make the code provably secure.

2105
02:01:02,360 --> 02:01:05,480
Our second contribution is
a leak repair technique

2106
02:01:05,480 --> 02:01:08,160
based on type driven
program synthesis.

2107
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:09,840
In the rest of this talk,

2108
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:13,600
I will first introduce our encoding
of IFC into liquid types.

2109
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:17,640
I will then give a demo of what
it's like to program in Lifty.

2110
02:01:17,640 --> 02:01:20,560
And finally, I will
give an overall review

2111
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:22,760
of how Lifty's leak repair works.

2112
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:26,920
In the liquid types system,

2113
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:29,560
types are annotated with
logical predicates

2114
02:01:29,560 --> 02:01:31,240
called refinements.

2115
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:33,400
For example, this is how

2116
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:35,920
you would specify
the type of natural numbers.

2117
02:01:36,440 --> 02:01:39,040
By restricting refinements
to decidable logics,

2118
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:42,040
liquid types provide fully
automatic type checking

2119
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:44,120
of non-trivial program properties,

2120
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:48,200
but can we use refinement types
to encode security policies?

2121
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:51,520
To answer this question,
we draw inspiration

2122
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:54,960
from another line of prior
work, security monads.

2123
02:01:55,880 --> 02:01:59,520
In this approach, computations
that manipulate sensitive data

2124
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:04,120
live inside a special monad
which we will refer to as TIO.

2125
02:02:04,120 --> 02:02:08,640
For example, TIO Int is
the type of sensitive computations

2126
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:10,720
that return an integer.

2127
02:02:11,080 --> 02:02:12,320
The purpose of the security monad

2128
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:15,440
is to keep track of
the security level of the data

2129
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:17,320
that the computation manipulates

2130
02:02:17,320 --> 02:02:20,840
and to disallow unsafe
information flows.

2131
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:26,320
In Lifty, the security level is
recorded in the TIO type itself.

2132
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:28,360
Apart from the return type,

2133
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:31,240
TIO is parameterized by
two refinement predicate -

2134
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:33,640
the input and the output label

2135
02:02:34,040 --> 02:02:37,520
which specify the security levels
of the input and output effects

2136
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:39,760
of a TIO computation.

2137
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:44,120
More precisely, the input labels
specifies the set of users

2138
02:02:44,120 --> 02:02:47,680
that are allowed to see
the data read by this computation.

2139
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:50,680
The output label specifies
the set of users

2140
02:02:50,680 --> 02:02:54,200
who will see the data
written by this computation.

2141
02:02:54,680 --> 02:02:57,640
Both labels are predicates
from the refinement logic

2142
02:02:57,640 --> 02:03:00,120
and can refer to variables in scope

2143
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:02,520
as well as a special
viewer variable.

2144
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:08,160
Now, let's see how our Lifty
programmer builds TIO computations.

2145
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:11,480
The building blocks
of a TIO computation

2146
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:15,800
are atomic input and output
actions that the programmer writes

2147
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:19,840
to model sources and sinks of
sensitive data in the system.

2148
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:23,880
For example, if my program
can access a shared key

2149
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:26,240
that belongs to Alice and Bob,

2150
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:28,600
I can give this action
in the following type.

2151
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:31,240
Here, the input label specifies

2152
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:33,680
that the key's only
visible to Alice and Bob,

2153
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:37,400
while the output label false
guarantees that this computation

2154
02:03:37,400 --> 02:03:41,240
will not perform any
user visible output.

2155
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:45,840
On the other hand, I can
define an output action print

2156
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:49,240
that outputs a string
to a given recipient.

2157
02:03:49,640 --> 02:03:52,520
The output label of
its type guarantees

2158
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:55,800
that only the intended
recipient will see the string

2159
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:59,280
while the input label true indicates

2160
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:01,960
that the return value
unit is public.

2161
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:04,680
Good luck trying to hide a unit.

2162
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:08,600
Know that function types in
Lifty can be dependent,

2163
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:13,320
so the label of the result can depend
on the value of the argument.

2164
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:17,240
This allows Lifty programmers to
encode rich security policies

2165
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:19,680
as types of TIO actions.

2166
02:04:20,840 --> 02:04:26,120
Atomic actions are combined into
computations using the TIO API

2167
02:04:26,120 --> 02:04:27,960
that Lifty provides.

2168
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:31,880
The core of the API under
standard monadic primitives

2169
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:33,960
return and bind.

2170
02:04:33,960 --> 02:04:38,320
Return simply wraps a pure value
into a sensitive computation.

2171
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:40,800
And so, its labels are trivial.

2172
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:42,880
The type of bind on the other hand

2173
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:46,880
is key to correctly tracking
information flow in Lifty.

2174
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:50,520
Bind sequences two
computations X and Y

2175
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:53,800
such that the result
of X flows into Y.

2176
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:58,120
The type of bind is polymorphic
in labels of these actions,

2177
02:04:58,120 --> 02:05:00,960
but not any four labels would do.

2178
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:06,560
To avoid leaks, we need to ensure
that Y only outputs to those users

2179
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:09,200
who are allowed to
see the result of X.

2180
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:13,520
This is encoded by adding
the input label i of X

2181
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:16,360
as a conjunct to
the output label of Y

2182
02:05:16,360 --> 02:05:21,480
essentially enforcing that Y's output
label is more restrictive than i.

2183
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:25,760
Finally, the input label of
the sequence of X and Y

2184
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:28,120
is the conjunction of
their input labels

2185
02:05:28,120 --> 02:05:31,960
and the output label is
the disjunction of their output labels.

2186
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:36,520
The TIO API has a third
primitive operation

2187
02:05:36,520 --> 02:05:40,400
(INAUDIBLE) free downgrade
which plays an important role

2188
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:42,520
in applications with rich policies

2189
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:45,760
but I will skip this description
in the interest of time.

2190
02:05:47,120 --> 02:05:49,280
The TIO library also provides

2191
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:52,040
a range of convenient
monadic combinators -

2192
02:05:52,040 --> 02:05:57,040
for example, mapM for mapping
a sensitive computation over a list.

2193
02:05:57,280 --> 02:05:59,920
Note that while
the primitive operations

2194
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:02,240
are part of the trusted
computing base,

2195
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:04,560
the derived operations are not.

2196
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,840
They're implemented in terms
of the primitive operations

2197
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:10,800
and the type check
using Lifty itself.

2198
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:12,840
Now, let's see how I can use Lifty

2199
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:16,560
to implement some simple functionality
of a conference manager.

2200
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:20,360
Say I'm on the program
committee of IFCP 20

2201
02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:22,840
and I'm viewing the list
of all submissions,

2202
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:27,200
but I'm also an author of one of
the submissions highlighted in grey.

2203
02:06:27,880 --> 02:06:30,960
As an author, I have a conflict
with this submsision.

2204
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:35,520
The conference manager has
a policy that a conflicted reviewer

2205
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:39,760
is not supposed to learn
the score or the decision for a paper

2206
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:41,920
until the notifications are out.

2207
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:46,200
Consider the following
hypothetical but insidious leak

2208
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:48,360
that violates this policy.

2209
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:54,240
As a reviewer, I can sort the list
of all submissions by their score.

2210
02:06:54,240 --> 02:06:56,400
If the programmer's not careful,

2211
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:59,760
the sorting function might
use the true hidden value

2212
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:03,200
of the score for my
paper for ordering.

2213
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:06,480
In this case, even though
the score is still masked,

2214
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:09,520
by looking at the position
of my paper in the list,

2215
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:14,720
I can infer that the score is
somewhere between 1.8 and 2.0

2216
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:17,160
and hence, the paper has
likely been accepted.

2217
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:18,400
Yes!

2218
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:22,840
Let's see how Lifty would
help us prevent this leak.

2219
02:07:23,320 --> 02:07:25,600
To implement a conference
manager in Lifty,

2220
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:28,600
I'll start by encoding
the interface to the data store

2221
02:07:28,600 --> 02:07:30,880
as a set of atomic TIO actions.

2222
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:33,520
For example, I'll add
an action that retrieves

2223
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:36,360
the list of all submission
IDs from the data store

2224
02:07:36,360 --> 02:07:40,040
and action that retrieves
a paper title by its ID

2225
02:07:40,040 --> 02:07:43,080
and so on for each column
of my submissions table.

2226
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:45,520
Now, it's time to add policies.

2227
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:48,600
Recall that paper scores
are restricted to users

2228
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:50,360
who are not conflicted
with the paper.

2229
02:07:50,360 --> 02:07:52,400
So, I would like to
change the input label

2230
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:55,080
of getPaperScore to
reflect this policy.

2231
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:57,680
Although the refinement
logic does not allow

2232
02:07:57,680 --> 02:07:59,280
mentioning program level functions

2233
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:02,160
like getPaperConflict inside labels.

2234
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:06,240
I can define an uninterpreted
logic level function conflicts

2235
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:09,840
that denotes the set of user
conflicted with a given paper.

2236
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:14,400
I can now use this function to
specify the desired policy on scores

2237
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:16,280
that they are only visible to users

2238
02:08:16,280 --> 02:08:18,280
who are not in the set of conflicts.

2239
02:08:18,680 --> 02:08:22,160
To connect my logic level function
to the data ID from the store,

2240
02:08:22,160 --> 02:08:25,920
I will refine the result
type of getPaperConflicts

2241
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:29,280
stating that it retrieves
exactly the same users

2242
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:31,600
as those denoted by conflicts.

2243
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:35,000
Finally, let's implement
the sorting functionality.

2244
02:08:35,360 --> 02:08:39,160
To this end, I will write
a function sortPapersByScore

2245
02:08:39,160 --> 02:08:41,560
that takes an input
at data store, ds

2246
02:08:41,560 --> 02:08:43,520
and the current user, client.

2247
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:46,480
Lifty supports
a Haskell-like do notation

2248
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:50,600
that desugars into invocatoins
of bind in a standard way.

2249
02:08:51,080 --> 02:08:53,560
Here, I first retrieved
the list of all submissions,

2250
02:08:53,560 --> 02:08:56,000
then sort them using
a custom comparator

2251
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,520
that I will implement shortly

2252
02:08:57,520 --> 02:08:59,280
and finally project the paper titles

2253
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:01,240
and output them to the current user.

2254
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:03,280
Our custom comparator function

2255
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:06,000
retrieves the scores of
the two papers from the store

2256
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,440
and compares them.

2257
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:10,640
I might not realize that
the functionality I just implemented

2258
02:09:10,640 --> 02:09:12,080
leaks information.

2259
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:15,480
After all, I'm only printing
paper titles which are public.

2260
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:18,280
Thankfully, Lifty is
watching my back.

2261
02:09:18,680 --> 02:09:21,040
If I ask to type check my program,

2262
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:23,360
it reports two policy violations

2263
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:25,720
for the two calls to getPaperScore.

2264
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:30,000
Lifty is complaining that
they're not visible to client.

2265
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,360
Instead of trying to
decipher that error message

2266
02:09:32,360 --> 02:09:33,840
and fix the leak myself

2267
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:36,200
I can ask lifty to do it for me.

2268
02:09:36,200 --> 02:09:39,440
In this case, lifty
returns a modified program

2269
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:43,760
where I call to get paper score
is wrapper in a power seacheck.

2270
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:47,280
The check retrieves
the conflict list for this paper

2271
02:09:47,280 --> 02:09:50,440
and checks whether
the client is on that list.

2272
02:09:50,440 --> 02:09:52,440
If client is in fact conflicted

2273
02:09:52,440 --> 02:09:57,240
our generated patch returns
a default score of zero.

2274
02:09:57,240 --> 02:09:58,720
In the final part of the talk

2275
02:09:58,720 --> 02:10:03,120
let's see how lifty's leak
repair works under the hood.

2276
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:06,960
Consider a stripdown version of
the leak I just showed you.

2277
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:10,440
In this version we simply
read the paper score

2278
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:12,760
and directly show it to the user

2279
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:15,600
who of course might be conflicted.

2280
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:18,040
How does lifty repair this leak?

2281
02:10:18,040 --> 02:10:20,800
The key insight is to
use the information

2282
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:23,120
from the failed type
checking attempt

2283
02:10:23,120 --> 02:10:29,200
to localize the leak and infer
a local specification for the patch.

2284
02:10:29,240 --> 02:10:34,240
First, let's desugar the denotation
into invocations of bind.

2285
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:35,880
While type checking the program

2286
02:10:35,880 --> 02:10:39,400
lifty infer the following
types for the two computations

2287
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:41,400
sequenced by bind.

2288
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:44,520
Now recall that our type
signature for bind

2289
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:47,800
enforces that the output label
of the second computation

2290
02:10:47,800 --> 02:10:51,640
be more restrictive than
the input label of the first one

2291
02:10:51,640 --> 02:10:53,480
hence type checking in this case

2292
02:10:53,480 --> 02:10:57,640
reduces to the following
implication between the labels.

2293
02:10:57,640 --> 02:11:01,760
Lifty uses SMT software to
validate this implication.

2294
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:03,760
In this case the check fails

2295
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:06,960
and the program is deemed ill-typed.

2296
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:10,040
Lifty keeps track of
which input action

2297
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:13,400
generated the right-hand side
of the failed implication.

2298
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:17,040
So it knows exactly
where the leak occurred.

2299
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:20,560
In this case, the problem is
the call to get paper score

2300
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:24,640
whose result is too
sensitive for its context.

2301
02:11:24,640 --> 02:11:28,400
To fix the leak lifty replaces
the offending input action

2302
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:29,880
with a patch template

2303
02:11:29,880 --> 02:11:33,800
whose intention is to return
the original value whenever it's safe

2304
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:39,280
and otherwise return a less
sensitive default or deducted value.

2305
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:41,360
Crucially the lifty type checker

2306
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:44,920
not only pinpoints the input
action that needs to be replaced

2307
02:11:44,920 --> 02:11:49,600
but also infers a local specification
that the patch needs to satisfy

2308
02:11:49,600 --> 02:11:52,160
in order for
the program to be secure.

2309
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:55,720
In particular, the optimal
input label for the patch

2310
02:11:55,720 --> 02:12:01,600
is derived directly from the left-hand
side of the failed implication.

2311
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:04,000
With the local specification at hand

2312
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:07,480
we can use our prior work on
type-driven program synthesis

2313
02:12:07,480 --> 02:12:10,080
to fill the holes in the patch,

2314
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:13,080
checking whether the client
is conflicted with the paper

2315
02:12:13,080 --> 02:12:16,520
and if so returning zero.

2316
02:12:16,600 --> 02:12:19,000
Thanks to the inferred
local specification

2317
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:23,560
synthesis is performed completely
independently for each leak.

2318
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:28,600
So leak repair scales reasonably well
to programs with multiple leaks

2319
02:12:28,600 --> 02:12:30,480
as we have seen in the demo.

2320
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:31,480
In conclusion,

2321
02:12:31,480 --> 02:12:35,680
we have presented a new static
IFC framework called lifty.

2322
02:12:35,680 --> 02:12:39,920
Lifty is able to statically
and automatically verify applications

2323
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:42,760
against rich security policies

2324
02:12:42,760 --> 02:12:44,680
and suggest leak patches

2325
02:12:44,680 --> 02:12:48,000
when the application does
not satisfy the policies.

2326
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,400
You can play with lifty
through our web interface

2327
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:55,400
available at this link.

2328
02:13:01,360 --> 02:13:04,440
ALAN JEFFREY: Thank you June and Nadia.

2329
02:13:04,440 --> 02:13:09,240
So there's going to be
live Q&A for this talk

2330
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:12,520
as you are in the New York timezone

2331
02:13:12,520 --> 02:13:17,080
and you can get to it as
usual by going to the link.

2332
02:13:17,080 --> 02:13:19,320
So now if you would like to join us

2333
02:13:19,320 --> 02:13:24,200
for the virtual (INAUDIBLE) inside
the conference hall

2334
02:13:24,240 --> 02:13:26,680
chatting and drinking coffee.

2335
02:13:26,680 --> 02:13:31,680
That would be great.
