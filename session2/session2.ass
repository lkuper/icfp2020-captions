Dialogue: 0,0:13:51.52,0:13:53.40,Default,,0,0,0,,Let me begin with\Nasking the question,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:53.40,0:13:56.56,Default,,0,0,0,,why we care about high\Nperformance in the first place?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:56.56,0:13:58.12,Default,,0,0,0,,And the answer is quite simple,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:58.24,0:14:00.72,Default,,0,0,0,,We literally cannot afford not to.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:00.72,0:14:03.68,Default,,0,0,0,,Because apparently it cost\Nabout a quarter million dollars
Dialogue: 0,0:14:03.92,0:14:07.12,Default,,0,0,0,,to perform state of the art\Nmachine learning research.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:07.12,0:14:08.64,Default,,0,0,0,,And this high cost is mostly due to
Dialogue: 0,0:14:08.96,0:14:12.52,Default,,0,0,0,,the long time required to train neural\Nnetworks on parallel hardware.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:14.20,0:14:17.64,Default,,0,0,0,,It gets worse when you translate\Nthe dollar spent into carbon emitted.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:18.32,0:14:20.12,Default,,0,0,0,,So here, training\Nthis neural network,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:20.32,0:14:22.12,Default,,0,0,0,,releases about five tons of carbon
Dialogue: 0,0:14:22.12,0:14:23.12,Default,,0,0,0,,into the atmosphere,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:23.44,0:14:27.00,Default,,0,0,0,,which is equivalent to driving\N11,000 miles with a car.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:27.00,0:14:29.44,Default,,0,0,0,,And just to show you\Nhow insane it is,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:29.44,0:14:31.28,Default,,0,0,0,,here's a map showing a road trip,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:31.52,0:14:32.84,Default,,0,0,0,,from the North of Norway,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:32.92,0:14:34.96,Default,,0,0,0,,all the way down to South Africa.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:34.96,0:14:37.56,Default,,0,0,0,,Which corresponds to\Nroughly 11,000 miles.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:37.60,0:14:39.52,Default,,0,0,0,,So clearly, we need to find a way,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:39.52,0:14:40.68,Default,,0,0,0,,to reduce those costs,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:40.72,0:14:43.56,Default,,0,0,0,,and optimizing a program, to\Nachieve high performance.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:43.56,0:14:47.32,Default,,0,0,0,,Might allow us to significantly\Nreduce the time required to,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:47.32,0:14:48.32,Default,,0,0,0,,to, for example,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:48.32,0:14:49.64,Default,,0,0,0,,train neural networks.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:51.24,0:14:54.32,Default,,0,0,0,,So, how do we achieve\Nhigh perfomance?
Dialogue: 0,0:14:54.32,0:14:55.52,Default,,0,0,0,,Here's a naive implementation
Dialogue: 0,0:14:55.52,0:14:58.60,Default,,0,0,0,,of a matrix multiplication\Nand computation in CUDA,
Dialogue: 0,0:14:58.60,0:15:00.64,Default,,0,0,0,,which targets GPU's.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:00.64,0:15:03.12,Default,,0,0,0,,And if you know, a little\Nbit about CUDA and GPU's,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:03.12,0:15:04.12,Default,,0,0,0,,I'd argue that,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:04.12,0:15:07.00,Default,,0,0,0,,this is quite easy to\Nwrite and to understand.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:07.00,0:15:10.56,Default,,0,0,0,,But unfortunately, this\Nprogram is also not very fast.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:10.56,0:15:14.80,Default,,0,0,0,,So, for achieving the highest\Nperformance on modern GPU's,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:14.92,0:15:18.68,Default,,0,0,0,,the simple program has to\Nbe significantly modified.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:18.68,0:15:21.04,Default,,0,0,0,,So for example, here is\Nan optimized version,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:21.04,0:15:22.84,Default,,0,0,0,,of the same computation,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:22.84,0:15:26.68,Default,,0,0,0,,which achieves up to three orders\Nof magnitude more performance.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:26.68,0:15:29.36,Default,,0,0,0,,And if we compare this again\Nto our road trip example,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:29.36,0:15:30.52,Default,,0,0,0,,and the carbon emitted,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:30.52,0:15:31.92,Default,,0,0,0,,a thousand X improvement
Dialogue: 0,0:15:31.92,0:15:36.00,Default,,0,0,0,,barely allows us to drive\N15 minutes on the highway.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:36.00,0:15:39.16,Default,,0,0,0,,However, this manual way of\Nachieving high performance,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:39.16,0:15:40.88,Default,,0,0,0,,requires some expert to sit down,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:40.96,0:15:43.88,Default,,0,0,0,,for quite some time,\Nand to optimize the program,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:43.88,0:15:47.84,Default,,0,0,0,,in a time intensive\Nand incredibly error prone process.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:47.84,0:15:49.44,Default,,0,0,0,,So, another way,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:49.44,0:15:50.80,Default,,0,0,0,,to achieve high performance,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:50.96,0:15:53.52,Default,,0,0,0,,is what I call the decoupled way,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:53.52,0:15:57.56,Default,,0,0,0,,which was pioneered by the domain\Nspecific compiler called Halide.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:57.56,0:15:58.84,Default,,0,0,0,,And the key idea here,
Dialogue: 0,0:15:58.84,0:16:01.52,Default,,0,0,0,,is to decouple what\Nis being computed,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:01.52,0:16:03.84,Default,,0,0,0,,from how it is optimized.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:03.84,0:16:07.12,Default,,0,0,0,,So this allows a domain scientist,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:07.12,0:16:09.36,Default,,0,0,0,,to focus on implementing\Nthe computation,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:09.36,0:16:11.52,Default,,0,0,0,,which can then be\Nseparately optimized,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:11.52,0:16:13.16,Default,,0,0,0,,by a performance engineer,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:13.16,0:16:15.20,Default,,0,0,0,,with the so called schedule.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:15.20,0:16:16.96,Default,,0,0,0,,And this way of achieving\Nhigh performance,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:16.96,0:16:18.44,Default,,0,0,0,,is currently very popular,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:18.44,0:16:20.84,Default,,0,0,0,,there're many compilers\Nfollowing this approach.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:20.84,0:16:23.32,Default,,0,0,0,,So, this particular example here,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:23.32,0:16:27.04,Default,,0,0,0,,is taken from the TVM\Nmachine learning compiler,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:27.04,0:16:28.68,Default,,0,0,0,,which is currently\Nthe state of the art,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:28.68,0:16:31.80,Default,,0,0,0,,in generating high performance\Nmachine learning implementation.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:32.80,0:16:34.60,Default,,0,0,0,,TVM comes with a tutorial
Dialogue: 0,0:16:34.60,0:16:38.20,Default,,0,0,0,,on how to optimize matrix\Nmodifications for CPU's.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:38.20,0:16:41.52,Default,,0,0,0,,And we'll take a closer\Nlook at that in a moment.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:43.08,0:16:46.68,Default,,0,0,0,,So the TVM compiler uses both\Nthe algorithm and the schedule,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:46.84,0:16:48.92,Default,,0,0,0,,to generate an efficient\Nimplementation.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:48.92,0:16:51.52,Default,,0,0,0,,So here, for example, we\Nsee the blocking version
Dialogue: 0,0:16:51.52,0:16:52.88,Default,,0,0,0,,from the TVM tutorial,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:52.92,0:16:56.32,Default,,0,0,0,,which applies some specific\Ngroup transformations.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:56.32,0:16:58.32,Default,,0,0,0,,The best version presented\Nin this tutorial,
Dialogue: 0,0:16:58.32,0:17:00.84,Default,,0,0,0,,is about 200 times faster\Nthan the baseline,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:00.84,0:17:04.64,Default,,0,0,0,,but only requires to add a few\Nmore lines to the schedule,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:04.64,0:17:06.68,Default,,0,0,0,,or at least that's the idea.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:06.68,0:17:09.72,Default,,0,0,0,,So when you take\Na closer look at this,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:09.72,0:17:11.32,Default,,0,0,0,,the schedule based approach,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:11.32,0:17:13.24,Default,,0,0,0,,you'll find a few problems.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:13.24,0:17:15.64,Default,,0,0,0,,One of the first few\Nthings you might find is that
Dialogue: 0,0:17:15.64,0:17:19.00,Default,,0,0,0,,the algorithm and\Nthe schedule are not fully separated.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:19.00,0:17:22.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Here, the schedule uses\Nthe same path in identifier,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:22.04,0:17:24.12,Default,,0,0,0,,that has been declared\Nin the algorithm.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:24.12,0:17:25.40,Default,,0,0,0,,And that simply means that,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:25.40,0:17:27.12,Default,,0,0,0,,both the algorithm and the schedule
Dialogue: 0,0:17:27.12,0:17:28.92,Default,,0,0,0,,have to live in the same scope,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:28.92,0:17:31.40,Default,,0,0,0,,and that hinders\Nthe re-use of the schedule,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:31.40,0:17:34.88,Default,,0,0,0,,for optimizing\Na different computation.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:34.88,0:17:37.68,Default,,0,0,0,,The next problem is that there's\Nno well-defined semantics,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:37.68,0:17:39.64,Default,,0,0,0,,for the scheduling preemptives.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:39.64,0:17:41.48,Default,,0,0,0,,So there's only\Na documentation online,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:41.48,0:17:42.92,Default,,0,0,0,,And for some primitives,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:42.92,0:17:45.96,Default,,0,0,0,,this is quite cryptic\Nand basically requires,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:45.96,0:17:48.60,Default,,0,0,0,,knowledge of how the compiler\Ninternally implements
Dialogue: 0,0:17:48.60,0:17:50.68,Default,,0,0,0,,the scheduling primitives.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:50.68,0:17:54.04,Default,,0,0,0,,And finally, all scheduling\Nprimitives are built in,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:54.04,0:17:56.32,Default,,0,0,0,,which makes them hard to extend.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:56.32,0:17:57.84,Default,,0,0,0,,So typically every  primitive,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:57.84,0:17:59.24,Default,,0,0,0,,like tile or vectorize,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:59.24,0:18:00.96,Default,,0,0,0,,represents a common\Noptimization,
Dialogue: 0,0:18:00.96,0:18:02.72,Default,,0,0,0,,you might want to apply,
Dialogue: 0,0:18:02.72,0:18:04.88,Default,,0,0,0,,but as soon as you need\Nsomething slightly different
Dialogue: 0,0:18:04.88,0:18:05.88,Default,,0,0,0,,you're in trouble.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:05.88,0:18:09.16,Default,,0,0,0,,Because, there's no easy way to extend\Nthe set of exposed optimizations
Dialogue: 0,0:18:09.16,0:18:12.48,Default,,0,0,0,,besides digging deep into\Nthe implementation of the compiler itself.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:12.52,0:18:16.32,Default,,0,0,0,,And this is something we\Ndon't often want to do.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:17.44,0:18:20.20,Default,,0,0,0,,So, this is why with our\Nfunctional approach,
Dialogue: 0,0:18:20.20,0:18:21.72,Default,,0,0,0,,we aim for a more principled way,
Dialogue: 0,0:18:21.72,0:18:25.04,Default,,0,0,0,,to describe and apply high-performance\Nprogram optimizations.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:26.20,0:18:29.72,Default,,0,0,0,,Specifically, we aim\Nto separate concerns, by
Dialogue: 0,0:18:30.16,0:18:32.28,Default,,0,0,0,,specifying computation at\Na high obstruction level only,
Dialogue: 0,0:18:32.28,0:18:36.84,Default,,0,0,0,,without changing them for\Nexpressing optimizations.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:37.00,0:18:41.16,Default,,0,0,0,,We aim to facilitate reuse by\Ndefining optimization strategies,
Dialogue: 0,0:18:41.16,0:18:44.28,Default,,0,0,0,,clearly separated from\Nthe computations.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:44.28,0:18:48.00,Default,,0,0,0,,We aim to enable composability\Nby allowing to define both
Dialogue: 0,0:18:48.00,0:18:50.92,Default,,0,0,0,,computations and optimizations\Nas compositions of
Dialogue: 0,0:18:50.92,0:18:54.68,Default,,0,0,0,,user defined building blocks.\NWe aim to allow reasoning by
Dialogue: 0,0:18:54.68,0:18:57.28,Default,,0,0,0,,giving those building blocks\Nwell-defined semantics.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:57.28,0:19:00.72,Default,,0,0,0,,And finally, we aim to be\Nexplicit and avoid all implicit
Dialogue: 0,0:19:00.72,0:19:02.60,Default,,0,0,0,,default behavior of the compiler.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:02.96,0:19:05.52,Default,,0,0,0,,And essentially we argue that\Na strategy language should
Dialogue: 0,0:19:05.52,0:19:07.84,Default,,0,0,0,,be built with the same\Nstandards as a language
Dialogue: 0,0:19:07.84,0:19:12.40,Default,,0,0,0,,describing the computation. Now,\Nlet me show you the functional,
Dialogue: 0,0:19:12.40,0:19:14.88,Default,,0,0,0,,way of achieving\Nhigh performance.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:15.32,0:19:18.16,Default,,0,0,0,,In our approach we follow\Nthe same idea of decoupling
Dialogue: 0,0:19:18.16,0:19:22.20,Default,,0,0,0,,computations and optimizations,\Nbut we're using the well established
Dialogue: 0,0:19:22.20,0:19:25.76,Default,,0,0,0,,functional programming\Ntechniques to express both.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:25.92,0:19:29.36,Default,,0,0,0,,So on the top left, we have a high\Nlevel program that is written in
Dialogue: 0,0:19:29.36,0:19:31.20,Default,,0,0,0,,the function programming\Nlanguage called rise.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:31.20,0:19:34.76,Default,,0,0,0,,That is based on\Nthe ICFP paper from 2015.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:35.04,0:19:38.52,Default,,0,0,0,,And on the right, you see\Nan optimization strategy that describes
Dialogue: 0,0:19:38.52,0:19:42.44,Default,,0,0,0,,how to optimize that rise program.\NAnd this is written in elevate,
Dialogue: 0,0:19:42.44,0:19:46.08,Default,,0,0,0,,which is based on ideas already\Npublished in the late nineties.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:47.20,0:19:50.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Our compiler then rewrites\Nthe rise program based on the
Dialogue: 0,0:19:50.80,0:19:53.56,Default,,0,0,0,,optimizations described in\Nthe elevate strategy and
Dialogue: 0,0:19:53.56,0:19:56.44,Default,,0,0,0,,eventually generates\Nhigh performance code.
Dialogue: 0,0:19:57.00,0:19:59.88,Default,,0,0,0,,Our functional pearl is all\Nabout how to express the high
Dialogue: 0,0:19:59.88,0:20:03.00,Default,,0,0,0,,performance optimizations\Ntypically applied manually or

Dialogue: 0,0:20:10.28,0:20:13.52,Default,,0,0,0,,Alright, let's see how we do\Nthis and we'll start by taking

Dialogue: 0,0:20:15.64,0:20:18.28,Default,,0,0,0,,for describing the optimizations.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:18.44,0:20:22.48,Default,,0,0,0,,The most basic building block\Nin elevate is a strategy and
Dialogue: 0,0:20:22.48,0:20:25.44,Default,,0,0,0,,a strategy is simply a function\Nfrom some program P to what
Dialogue: 0,0:20:25.44,0:20:29.80,Default,,0,0,0,,we call a rewrite result and\Na rewrite result is simply saying
Dialogue: 0,0:20:29.80,0:20:33.44,Default,,0,0,0,,whether the applied strategy\Nsucceeded in which case it contains
Dialogue: 0,0:20:33.44,0:20:36.84,Default,,0,0,0,,the rewritten program,\Nor it failed in which case it
Dialogue: 0,0:20:36.84,0:20:39.32,Default,,0,0,0,,contained the strategy,\Nwhich failed.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:39.52,0:20:42.32,Default,,0,0,0,,Rewrite rules are examples\Nfor very simple strategies.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:42.32,0:20:44.52,Default,,0,0,0,,And you could, for example,\Ngo ahead and implement
Dialogue: 0,0:20:44.52,0:20:49.04,Default,,0,0,0,,the typical fusion rule for rise\Nprograms as an elevate strategy.
Dialogue: 0,0:20:49.04,0:20:52.48,Default,,0,0,0,,As you see on the bottom. This\Nrule simply says that whenever
Dialogue: 0,0:20:52.48,0:20:55.48,Default,,0,0,0,,you see a rise program that\Ncontains two consecutive maps,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:55.48,0:20:58.48,Default,,0,0,0,,you can fuse those maps\Nand return the fused program,
Dialogue: 0,0:20:58.48,0:21:00.76,Default,,0,0,0,,and if there are no\Nconsecutive two maps,
Dialogue: 0,0:21:00.76,0:21:03.96,Default,,0,0,0,,then this rule is simply not\Napplicable and it fails.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:05.24,0:21:08.72,Default,,0,0,0,,For building more powerful strategies,\Nwe can combine tools
Dialogue: 0,0:21:08.72,0:21:11.48,Default,,0,0,0,,and elevate using several\Ndifferent combinators.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:11.64,0:21:14.60,Default,,0,0,0,,So for example,\Nthe sequence combinator allows
Dialogue: 0,0:21:14.60,0:21:17.16,Default,,0,0,0,,to apply two strategies in sequence.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:17.48,0:21:21.20,Default,,0,0,0,,The left choice operator\Nexpects also two strategies,
Dialogue: 0,0:21:21.20,0:21:24.52,Default,,0,0,0,,but only applies the second one\Nin case the first one fails.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:24.88,0:21:28.52,Default,,0,0,0,,The try combinator tries to\Napply the given strategy and
Dialogue: 0,0:21:28.52,0:21:30.84,Default,,0,0,0,,if it is not applicable, it's\Nsimply returns the unchanged
Dialogue: 0,0:21:30.84,0:21:33.80,Default,,0,0,0,,input program by applying\Nthe ID strategy.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:33.80,0:21:38.16,Default,,0,0,0,,And finally, the repeat strategy\Nallows us to repetitively apply
Dialogue: 0,0:21:38.16,0:21:41.24,Default,,0,0,0,,the same strategy until it\Nis no longer applicable.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:42.04,0:21:44.88,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, what if we have\Nthe following situation.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:45.12,0:21:48.12,Default,,0,0,0,,Here you see a rise program\Nthat contains three maps.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:48.12,0:21:51.60,Default,,0,0,0,,And if we now want to apply\Nthe mapfusion rule, we have just defined,
Dialogue: 0,0:21:51.60,0:21:54.52,Default,,0,0,0,,there are two possible\Nlocations for fusing the maps.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:54.52,0:21:57.88,Default,,0,0,0,,So we can either use the first\Ntwo or the last two maps.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:58.24,0:22:01.12,Default,,0,0,0,,And with elevate, you can\Nprecisely define locations in
Dialogue: 0,0:22:01.12,0:22:03.92,Default,,0,0,0,,the AST using so-called traverses.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:04.08,0:22:07.32,Default,,0,0,0,,So for example, the body traversal\Napplies a given strategy at
Dialogue: 0,0:22:07.32,0:22:09.44,Default,,0,0,0,,the body of a function\Nabstruction mode.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:09.44,0:22:13.76,Default,,0,0,0,,And in this example, body\Nmapfusion would then fuse the
Dialogue: 0,0:22:13.76,0:22:16.16,Default,,0,0,0,,first two maps as we've seen here.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:16.52,0:22:19.48,Default,,0,0,0,,Similarly, we define traversals\Nfor the other nodes and
Dialogue: 0,0:22:19.48,0:22:22.80,Default,,0,0,0,,could for example, apply\Nfor the argument of fusion,
Dialogue: 0,0:22:22.80,0:22:26.44,Default,,0,0,0,,for fusing the last thing that's in\Nthis expression and in the paper,
Dialogue: 0,0:22:26.44,0:22:29.32,Default,,0,0,0,,we explained in more detail how\Nto describe precise locations
Dialogue: 0,0:22:29.32,0:22:31.96,Default,,0,0,0,,using these and other traverses.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:32.36,0:22:35.76,Default,,0,0,0,,Sometimes it's not desirable\Nto specify a precise path,
Dialogue: 0,0:22:35.76,0:22:38.84,Default,,0,0,0,,but instead we might want to\Nsay something like apply this
Dialogue: 0,0:22:38.84,0:22:41.32,Default,,0,0,0,,given strategy at\Nthe first place you'll find,
Dialogue: 0,0:22:41.32,0:22:44.92,Default,,0,0,0,,and this is what bottom\Nup or top down do.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:44.92,0:22:49.24,Default,,0,0,0,,So these traverses strategies,\Ntraverse AST either like from top
Dialogue: 0,0:22:49.24,0:22:52.24,Default,,0,0,0,,down or bottom up\Nand apply the given strategy
Dialogue: 0,0:22:52.24,0:22:55.68,Default,,0,0,0,,at the first place where it's\Napplicable and then stop.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:56.52,0:22:59.56,Default,,0,0,0,,Another useful traversal is\Nthe normalized strategy,
Dialogue: 0,0:22:59.56,0:23:02.60,Default,,0,0,0,,which applies a given strategy\Nexhaustively until it is no longer
Dialogue: 0,0:23:02.60,0:23:05.28,Default,,0,0,0,,applicable anywhere in\Nthe give expression.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:05.28,0:23:08.80,Default,,0,0,0,,And in the paper we define a few\Nnormal forms for rise expression.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:08.80,0:23:11.44,Default,,0,0,0,,And one simple example\Nfor one of those is
Dialogue: 0,0:23:11.44,0:23:14.68,Default,,0,0,0,,the beta eta-normal form, which\Nsimply applies beta reduction
Dialogue: 0,0:23:14.68,0:23:17.60,Default,,0,0,0,,and eta reduction\Nas often as possible.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:18.12,0:23:21.28,Default,,0,0,0,,Using those generic building\Nblocks, we then try to implement
Dialogue: 0,0:23:21.28,0:23:24.64,Default,,0,0,0,,TVM scheduling language\Nand try to especially define

Dialogue: 0,0:23:32.28,0:23:34.60,Default,,0,0,0,,So here's what the baseline\Nversion looks like.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:34.60,0:23:37.80,Default,,0,0,0,,And for TVM, we described\Nthe matrix multiplication using

Dialogue: 0,0:23:40.88,0:23:43.36,Default,,0,0,0,,to generate unoptimized code.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:43.88,0:23:46.88,Default,,0,0,0,,For our functional way, we describe\Nthe matrix multiplication

Dialogue: 0,0:23:51.76,0:23:54.84,Default,,0,0,0,,And we define a separate\Nstrategy in elevate,
Dialogue: 0,0:23:54.84,0:23:58.56,Default,,0,0,0,,which explained how to\Noptimize this computation.
Dialogue: 0,0:23:58.96,0:24:01.64,Default,,0,0,0,,And here we can already see that\Nwe have a clear separation

Dialogue: 0,0:24:04.48,0:24:09.36,Default,,0,0,0,,More crucially TVM's default\Nstrategy implicitly describes

Dialogue: 0,0:24:12.48,0:24:15.60,Default,,0,0,0,,And we don't really know\Nhow this is performed.
Dialogue: 0,0:24:15.92,0:24:19.28,Default,,0,0,0,,With our approach, we aim to\Ncompletely avoid implicit behavior
Dialogue: 0,0:24:19.28,0:24:22.24,Default,,0,0,0,,and describe every\Ntransformation explicitly.
Dialogue: 0,0:24:22.60,0:24:25.12,Default,,0,0,0,,So here, we're simply saying\Nthat the dot product should
Dialogue: 0,0:24:25.12,0:24:28.16,Default,,0,0,0,,be computed using a single\Nstatement, by fusing the map and
Dialogue: 0,0:24:28.16,0:24:32.32,Default,,0,0,0,,the reduce pattern, similar to\Nhow TVM computes the dot product.
Dialogue: 0,0:24:32.96,0:24:35.44,Default,,0,0,0,,This way we implemented each of the
Dialogue: 0,0:24:35.44,0:24:37.36,Default,,0,0,0,,seven differently optimized versions.
Dialogue: 0,0:24:37.36,0:24:40.40,Default,,0,0,0,,And in the paper we described,\Nfor example, how to implement

Dialogue: 0,0:24:46.36,0:24:50.36,Default,,0,0,0,,traversals we've just seen.\NAlso our functional approach
Dialogue: 0,0:24:50.36,0:24:52.60,Default,,0,0,0,,allows us to define\Nthe different optimized versions
Dialogue: 0,0:24:52.60,0:24:55.88,Default,,0,0,0,,as reusable strategies.\NSo here, for example,
Dialogue: 0,0:24:55.88,0:24:57.88,Default,,0,0,0,,we define the loop perms strategy,
Dialogue: 0,0:24:57.88,0:25:02.00,Default,,0,0,0,,which we will reuse in\Nthe following more optimized versions.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:02.72,0:25:05.40,Default,,0,0,0,,This is the most optimized\Nversion implemented
Dialogue: 0,0:25:05.40,0:25:07.32,Default,,0,0,0,,in both TVM and our approach.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:07.32,0:25:10.32,Default,,0,0,0,,And here you can see that\Nwe are able to reuse and
Dialogue: 0,0:25:10.32,0:25:12.44,Default,,0,0,0,,to build upon\Nthe loop perm strategy,
Dialogue: 0,0:25:12.44,0:25:15.92,Default,,0,0,0,,whereas in TVM we always have to\Ndescribe the whole optimization
Dialogue: 0,0:25:15.92,0:25:19.88,Default,,0,0,0,,from scratch because we cannot\Neasily define our own abstruction.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:19.88,0:25:23.68,Default,,0,0,0,,One crucial problem is also that\Nthe TVM algorithm has to be
Dialogue: 0,0:25:23.68,0:25:27.20,Default,,0,0,0,,changed a few times during\Nthe tutorial because the scheduling
Dialogue: 0,0:25:27.20,0:25:28.92,Default,,0,0,0,,language is not powerful enough
Dialogue: 0,0:25:28.92,0:25:31.52,Default,,0,0,0,,to express all desirable\Noptimizations.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:31.84,0:25:35.32,Default,,0,0,0,,Our approach with rise and elevate\Ndoes not require us to do so.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:35.32,0:25:39.12,Default,,0,0,0,,And we use the same rise matrix\Nmultiplication that is optimized
Dialogue: 0,0:25:39.12,0:25:42.64,Default,,0,0,0,,by seven different\Nand separate elevate strategies.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:43.40,0:25:46.20,Default,,0,0,0,,To evaluate our approach,\Nwe look at two things.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:46.20,0:25:51.92,Default,,0,0,0,,So first in the first experiment,\Nwe simply counted the number of
Dialogue: 0,0:25:51.96,0:25:55.24,Default,,0,0,0,,successful rewrite steps for\Nversions, which you can see here.
Dialogue: 0,0:25:55.24,0:25:58.80,Default,,0,0,0,,And since the baseline version\Ndoes not perform any interesting
Dialogue: 0,0:25:58.80,0:26:03.28,Default,,0,0,0,,transformations it only\Nrequires a few rewrite steps.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:03.28,0:26:06.80,Default,,0,0,0,,But as soon as we're performing\Nactual program optimizations,
Dialogue: 0,0:26:06.80,0:26:10.44,Default,,0,0,0,,we reach about yeah,\N45 thousands and
Dialogue: 0,0:26:10.44,0:26:13.40,Default,,0,0,0,,later up to 62,000\Nseparate rewrites steps.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:13.68,0:26:16.24,Default,,0,0,0,,And this shows that our\Napproach is scalable because
Dialogue: 0,0:26:16.24,0:26:19.12,Default,,0,0,0,,we were able to define\Nthe complex TVM like optimizations
Dialogue: 0,0:26:19.12,0:26:22.56,Default,,0,0,0,,by simply composing a few\Nrewrite rules using elevate.
Dialogue: 0,0:26:22.84,0:26:26.28,Default,,0,0,0,,Also performing this many steps\Ntook less than two seconds

Dialogue: 0,0:26:30.44,0:26:33.68,Default,,0,0,0,,Obviously we also wanted to see\Nif the performance we achieve

Dialogue: 0,0:37:58.88,0:38:00.40,Default,,0,0,0,,JAMIE: OK, so let's have a look
Dialogue: 0,0:38:00.44,0:38:01.88,Default,,0,0,0,,at the machine state the where it's interpreted
Dialogue: 0,0:38:01.96,0:38:03.08,Default,,0,0,0,,and see what we can\Nuncover.
Dialogue: 0,0:38:03.48,0:38:06.92,Default,,0,0,0,,So quickly, let's look at how we actually\Nevaluate the machine,
Dialogue: 0,0:38:06.92,0:38:08.68,Default,,0,0,0,,normally with the run\Nmachine function.
Dialogue: 0,0:38:09.00,0:38:10.84,Default,,0,0,0,,So, we're going to\Nprovide some machine
Dialogue: 0,0:38:10.92,0:38:12.52,Default,,0,0,0,,state gamma to the eval function,
Dialogue: 0,0:38:12.52,0:38:13.76,Default,,0,0,0,,and that's going to interpret
Dialogue: 0,0:38:13.76,0:38:15.68,Default,,0,0,0,,the meaning of each instruction.
Dialogue: 0,0:38:15.84,0:38:17.92,Default,,0,0,0,,So, all gamma is is just a
Dialogue: 0,0:38:18.52,0:38:20.40,Default,,0,0,0,,our heterogeneous open\Nstack along with a return
Dialogue: 0,0:38:20.48,0:38:22.96,Default,,0,0,0,,continuation\Nfor recursion a stack
Dialogue: 0,0:38:23.00,0:38:25.44,Default,,0,0,0,,for failure handlers\Nand the input xs itself.
Dialogue: 0,0:38:25.84,0:38:27.20,Default,,0,0,0,,And so the bit that we can actually
Dialogue: 0,0:38:27.24,0:38:29.24,Default,,0,0,0,,stage about this would\Nbe the eval function,
Dialogue: 0,0:38:29.76,0:38:30.80,Default,,0,0,0,,because it's the machine
Dialogue: 0,0:38:30.88,0:38:32.60,Default,,0,0,0,,that's done at compile time, right.
Dialogue: 0,0:38:33.00,0:38:35.84,Default,,0,0,0,,So, if I just add code around it,
Dialogue: 0,0:38:36.24,0:38:38.80,Default,,0,0,0,,then that makes\Nthe function from machine
Dialogue: 0,0:38:38.80,0:38:40.80,Default,,0,0,0,,state to final value code
Dialogue: 0,0:38:40.84,0:38:42.84,Default,,0,0,0,,and that, that'll be done at run time.
Dialogue: 0,0:38:43.24,0:38:45.32,Default,,0,0,0,,And you can break this into\Na compile time function
Dialogue: 0,0:38:45.32,0:38:46.72,Default,,0,0,0,,that takes code and returns code
Dialogue: 0,0:38:46.76,0:38:48.36,Default,,0,0,0,,that's fairly straightforward,
Dialogue: 0,0:38:48.76,0:38:51.24,Default,,0,0,0,,but we should get to\Nmore than this, right.
Dialogue: 0,0:38:51.88,0:38:54.40,Default,,0,0,0,,So the machines take gammas\Nalways the same shape,
Dialogue: 0,0:38:54.56,0:38:57.12,Default,,0,0,0,,so we should be able to get rid\Nof that at compile time too.
Dialogue: 0,0:38:57.84,0:39:00.60,Default,,0,0,0,,So if I push the code\Ninto the gamma,
Dialogue: 0,0:39:01.12,0:39:03.28,Default,,0,0,0,,then we can ensure it\Nonly exist at a compile time.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:03.80,0:39:06.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Yeah so runtime will produce\Na function with four arguments,
Dialogue: 0,0:39:06.84,0:39:09.56,Default,,0,0,0,,one for each component,\Nbut the actual records gone.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:10.80,0:39:12.96,Default,,0,0,0,,There's sort of this, gonna\Nbe more we can do now.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:13.76,0:39:15.24,Default,,0,0,0,,NICOLAS: Well,\Nthe fact that, H list.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:16.12,0:39:18.72,Default,,0,0,0,,In ops has the type Xs implies,
Dialogue: 0,0:39:19.00,0:39:21.88,Default,,0,0,0,,but it must have those, shape that\Nwe can do at compile time.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:22.20,0:39:23.92,Default,,0,0,0,,And that's determined by instructions
Dialogue: 0,0:39:23.92,0:39:25.24,Default,,0,0,0,,also known at compile time.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:25.28,0:39:28.00,Default,,0,0,0,,So you could push the code\Ninside the H list.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:28.60,0:39:31.28,Default,,0,0,0,,JAMIE: I see, so, if I map
Dialogue: 0,0:39:31.56,0:39:33.72,Default,,0,0,0,,the code over the values in the H list,
Dialogue: 0,0:39:34.48,0:39:37.80,Default,,0,0,0,,then the H list itself is only\Ngoing to exist at compile time,
Dialogue: 0,0:39:38.12,0:39:39.84,Default,,0,0,0,,and the values exist at runtime.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:40.60,0:39:43.16,Default,,0,0,0,,And I guess the structure,\Nthe handle stack is
Dialogue: 0,0:39:43.20,0:39:45.48,Default,,0,0,0,,the same it's determined by\Nthe instructions as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:46.04,0:39:49.48,Default,,0,0,0,,So I guess we can operate that\Nlist at compile time too.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:50.52,0:39:52.56,Default,,0,0,0,,So, with all things considered,
Dialogue: 0,0:39:52.64,0:39:54.08,Default,,0,0,0,,I guess the only thing\Nwe don't really know
Dialogue: 0,0:39:54.08,0:39:55.48,Default,,0,0,0,,at compile time is\Nwhat the input is,
Dialogue: 0,0:39:55.56,0:39:58.40,Default,,0,0,0,,and specifically what each\Ncontinuation is at any given point.
Dialogue: 0,0:39:58.80,0:40:00.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Everything else is gone
Dialogue: 0,0:40:00.28,0:40:01.84,Default,,0,0,0,,NICOLAS: Exactly and that's why we
Dialogue: 0,0:40:01.92,0:40:03.36,Default,,0,0,0,,like staging so much.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:03.48,0:40:06.00,Default,,0,0,0,,JAMIE: Awesome, so here's what\Nthe staged evaluation
Dialogue: 0,0:40:06.24,0:40:07.88,Default,,0,0,0,,for push and halt\Nlook like then.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:08.04,0:40:10.84,Default,,0,0,0,,So, halt will take\Nthe operand stack out of gamma
Dialogue: 0,0:40:10.84,0:40:12.24,Default,,0,0,0,,and extract the top element
Dialogue: 0,0:40:13.28,0:40:15.08,Default,,0,0,0,,and splice it into some code
Dialogue: 0,0:40:15.08,0:40:17.52,Default,,0,0,0,,that builds it just for\Nthat value at run time,
Dialogue: 0,0:40:18.28,0:40:20.08,Default,,0,0,0,,and eval push there aren't\Nactually any quotes
Dialogue: 0,0:40:20.12,0:40:23.04,Default,,0,0,0,,in the body at all,\N so it must purely happen at compile time.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:23.08,0:40:24.16,Default,,0,0,0,,That's really cool.
Dialogue: 0,0:40:24.56,0:40:27.04,Default,,0,0,0,,So, I guess let's\Npush
Dialogue: 0,0:40:27.08,0:40:28.16,Default,,0,0,0,,an example through this mechanism
Dialogue: 0,0:40:28.16,0:40:29.60,Default,,0,0,0,,and see what code it generates.

Dialogue: 0,0:40:32.56,0:40:34.96,Default,,0,0,0,,so I guess we can see that\Nnone of the abstractions

Dialogue: 0,0:41:07.72,0:41:08.80,Default,,0,0,0,,JAMIE: That's a pain,
Dialogue: 0,0:41:08.80,0:41:11.04,Default,,0,0,0,,I mean do you really need\Nto create a whole new parser

Dialogue: 0,0:41:14.12,0:41:16.52,Default,,0,0,0,,NICOLAS: I suppose, most of the time\Nthe grammar is static,
Dialogue: 0,0:41:16.52,0:41:17.80,Default,,0,0,0,,and bind is used to select

Dialogue: 0,0:44:53.48,0:44:56.60,Default,,0,0,0,,So we have a few\Nspecificity in Affe.
Dialogue: 0,0:44:56.72,0:45:02.68,Default,,0,0,0,,The first one is that we use\Nkinds, to determine usage.
Dialogue: 0,0:45:02.76,0:45:07.00,Default,,0,0,0,,So, here is a grade database\Nis of type database,

Dialogue: 0,0:46:09.24,0:46:11.56,Default,,0,0,0,,So as I said before\Nkinds determine usage.
Dialogue: 0,0:46:12.44,0:46:17.04,Default,,0,0,0,,We have three kinds linear, resource\Nmust be used exactly once.

Dialogue: 0,0:47:15.96,0:47:17.72,Default,,0,0,0,,Because then naturally,

Dialogue: 0,0:58:37.84,0:58:39.32,Default,,0,0,0,,They're for many reasons.
Dialogue: 0,0:58:39.32,0:58:42.36,Default,,0,0,0,,It's easy to encode terms\Nwith inductive types,

Dialogue: 0,0:58:46.64,0:58:50.20,Default,,0,0,0,,It's easy to traverse terms\Nwith higher-order combinators,
Dialogue: 0,0:58:50.20,0:58:55.08,Default,,0,0,0,,for example, it's easy to write\Nfunctions that replace sub-terms

Dialogue: 0,0:58:58.20,0:59:02.32,Default,,0,0,0,,And it's easy to backtrack using\Npersistent data-structures.
Dialogue: 0,0:59:02.32,0:59:05.96,Default,,0,0,0,,So, we can just snapshot the world,

Dialogue: 0,1:00:08.00,1:00:10.16,Default,,0,0,0,,And here's a little illustration.
Dialogue: 0,1:00:10.16,1:00:15.12,Default,,0,0,0,,On the left, there's a term\Nwhose dag representation

Dialogue: 0,1:00:29.92,1:00:33.36,Default,,0,0,0,,And perhaps a surprising\Nempirical finding
Dialogue: 0,1:00:33.36,1:00:35.84,Default,,0,0,0,,is that terms with\Nastronomic tree sizes

Dialogue: 0,1:00:39.56,1:00:43.28,Default,,0,0,0,,So, it's well known that even\Nbasic operations can produce them.

Dialogue: 0,1:00:58.44,1:01:02.60,Default,,0,0,0,,But in reality, terms are often\Nthe result of long chains

Dialogue: 0,1:01:48.12,1:01:53.12,Default,,0,0,0,,So, we present a new way to, quote,\N'Seal' the needed optimizations -
Dialogue: 0,1:01:53.32,1:01:57.16,Default,,0,0,0,,the optimizations that you need to\Ntraverse terms in linear time.
Dialogue: 0,1:01:57.16,1:01:59.32,Default,,0,0,0,,We show how to seal\Nthese optimizations
Dialogue: 0,1:01:59.32,1:02:02.00,Default,,0,0,0,,behind pure functional interfaces.
Dialogue: 0,1:02:02.00,1:02:04.60,Default,,0,0,0,,And here's the main idea.
Dialogue: 0,1:02:04.60,1:02:07.16,Default,,0,0,0,,We start with a pure\Nreference implementation
Dialogue: 0,1:02:07.16,1:02:10.32,Default,,0,0,0,,of something that we wanna optimize,
Dialogue: 0,1:02:10.32,1:02:13.96,Default,,0,0,0,,we find sufficient conditions\Nfor a particular optimization
Dialogue: 0,1:02:13.96,1:02:16.80,Default,,0,0,0,,to respect the reference\Nimplementation,
Dialogue: 0,1:02:16.80,1:02:20.00,Default,,0,0,0,,we then create a new primitive\Nthat takes these conditions
Dialogue: 0,1:02:20.00,1:02:23.24,Default,,0,0,0,,as 'preconditions'\Nusing dependent types
Dialogue: 0,1:02:23.24,1:02:27.24,Default,,0,0,0,,and otherwise is given the nominal\Npure reference implementation.
Dialogue: 0,1:02:27.24,1:02:31.52,Default,,0,0,0,,And then we just compile this\Nprimitive into the optimized version.
Dialogue: 0,1:02:31.52,1:02:34.08,Default,,0,0,0,,And a simple meta theoretic argument
Dialogue: 0,1:02:34.08,1:02:37.00,Default,,0,0,0,,establishes that\Nsince it was proved -
Dialogue: 0,1:02:37.00,1:02:41.40,Default,,0,0,0,,since the preconditions were approved,\Nthe optimization is settled.
Dialogue: 0,1:02:41.40,1:02:43.32,Default,,0,0,0,,And we show how to do\Nthis for several common
Dialogue: 0,1:02:43.32,1:02:47.08,Default,,0,0,0,,low-level optimizations,\Nincluding pointer equality tests,
Dialogue: 0,1:02:47.08,1:02:50.04,Default,,0,0,0,,and even direct\Npointer-address manipulations.
Dialogue: 0,1:02:50.04,1:02:52.08,Default,,0,0,0,,And we show how to use\Nthese new primitives
Dialogue: 0,1:02:52.08,1:02:53.72,Default,,0,0,0,,to traverse terms in linear time,
Dialogue: 0,1:02:53.72,1:02:56.72,Default,,0,0,0,,which is the problem\Nwe set out to solve.
Dialogue: 0,1:02:56.72,1:02:59.60,Default,,0,0,0,,So, perhaps the simplest\Npointer optimization
Dialogue: 0,1:02:59.60,1:03:04.28,Default,,0,0,0,,is just short-circuiting equality\Ntests using pointer equality.
Dialogue: 0,1:03:04.28,1:03:06.16,Default,,0,0,0,,And the idea is simple:
Dialogue: 0,1:03:06.16,1:03:09.56,Default,,0,0,0,,If two terms x and y have\Nthe same memory address,
Dialogue: 0,1:03:09.56,1:03:11.64,Default,,0,0,0,,they must be structurally equal.
Dialogue: 0,1:03:11.64,1:03:16.84,Default,,0,0,0,,So, you can skip the potentially\Nexponentially expensive
Dialogue: 0,1:03:16.92,1:03:19.76,Default,,0,0,0,,structural equality test\Nand just return true.
Dialogue: 0,1:03:19.76,1:03:21.88,Default,,0,0,0,,And the challenge here is\Nthat this optimization
Dialogue: 0,1:03:21.88,1:03:26.40,Default,,0,0,0,,is only sound in general\Nfor reflexive relations.
Dialogue: 0,1:03:26.44,1:03:28.76,Default,,0,0,0,,And the solution is somewhat simple:
Dialogue: 0,1:03:28.76,1:03:33.68,Default,,0,0,0,,Allow the optimization any relation\Nthat you can prove is reflexive.
Dialogue: 0,1:03:33.68,1:03:35.52,Default,,0,0,0,,Which brings us to our\Nfirst new primitive
Dialogue: 0,1:03:35.52,1:03:38.00,Default,,0,0,0,,which we call, 'withPtrEq'.
Dialogue: 0,1:03:38.00,1:03:42.72,Default,,0,0,0,,And now, withPtrEq takes two\Nterms x and y of type alpha,
Dialogue: 0,1:03:42.72,1:03:47.88,Default,,0,0,0,,and a thunk, k, that takes\Na unit type and returns Bool.
Dialogue: 0,1:03:47.88,1:03:54.24,Default,,0,0,0,,And the precondition, h,\Nis a proof that if x=y,
Dialogue: 0,1:03:54.24,1:03:57.48,Default,,0,0,0,,then this thunk, k, is\Ngoing to return true.
Dialogue: 0,1:03:57.48,1:04:00.76,Default,,0,0,0,,And then the overall primitive\NwithPtrEq returns Bool,
Dialogue: 0,1:04:00.76,1:04:05.40,Default,,0,0,0,,and it's pure reference implementation\Njust simply evaluates...
Dialogue: 0,1:04:05.40,1:04:08.36,Default,,0,0,0,,And now, the compiler will\Ntreat this as opaque
Dialogue: 0,1:04:08.36,1:04:10.96,Default,,0,0,0,,until reaching the low-level IR.
Dialogue: 0,1:04:10.96,1:04:15.36,Default,,0,0,0,,At which point it will\Nexpand a call to withPtrEq,
Dialogue: 0,1:04:15.36,1:04:18.28,Default,,0,0,0,,to the following\Npseudo code snippet:
Dialogue: 0,1:04:18.28,1:04:22.32,Default,,0,0,0,,It first checks of the pointer\Naddresses of the sale of x and y,
Dialogue: 0,1:04:22.32,1:04:25.88,Default,,0,0,0,,if they are it returns true,\Notherwise it evaluates it up.
Dialogue: 0,1:04:25.88,1:04:29.16,Default,,0,0,0,,And the precondition, h,\Nguarantees that this version
Dialogue: 0,1:04:29.16,1:04:33.28,Default,,0,0,0,,respects the pure version\Nby a very simple argument.
Dialogue: 0,1:04:33.28,1:04:37.24,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, withPtrEq alone already\Ncan yield exponential speedups
Dialogue: 0,1:04:37.24,1:04:40.40,Default,,0,0,0,,on pointer-equal terms trivially.
Dialogue: 0,1:04:40.40,1:04:44.80,Default,,0,0,0,,But small deviations from\Npointer-equal from pointer-equality
Dialogue: 0,1:04:44.80,1:04:46.64,Default,,0,0,0,,remove the benefit entirely.
Dialogue: 0,1:04:46.64,1:04:49.80,Default,,0,0,0,,So, this is\Nan illustration of two terms
Dialogue: 0,1:04:49.80,1:04:54.68,Default,,0,0,0,,that share memory pointer\Nshare an enormous tower,
Dialogue: 0,1:04:54.68,1:04:56.28,Default,,0,0,0,,but their heads are\Nactually different.
Dialogue: 0,1:04:56.28,1:05:00.80,Default,,0,0,0,,So, they are not themselves PtrEq,\Neven though their children are.
Dialogue: 0,1:05:00.80,1:05:04.04,Default,,0,0,0,,So, a single call to withPtrEq
Dialogue: 0,1:05:04.04,1:05:06.08,Default,,0,0,0,,will just see that they're\Nnot pointer-equal,
Dialogue: 0,1:05:06.08,1:05:10.08,Default,,0,0,0,,and fall back on recursive\Nstructural equality.
Dialogue: 0,1:05:10.08,1:05:14.52,Default,,0,0,0,,Obviously, what we want is to\Ncall withPtrEq recursively
Dialogue: 0,1:05:14.52,1:05:18.00,Default,,0,0,0,,on the children, and we can do that.
Dialogue: 0,1:05:18.00,1:05:19.60,Default,,0,0,0,,The construction is\Nsomewhat elaborate,
Dialogue: 0,1:05:19.60,1:05:23.64,Default,,0,0,0,,but it's entirely mechanizable,\Nrequires no new primitives,
Dialogue: 0,1:05:23.64,1:05:28.16,Default,,0,0,0,,and the paper goes into\Nthe details for those who are curious.
Dialogue: 0,1:05:28.16,1:05:32.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Now we're almost ready to\Ntraverse terms in linear-time.
Dialogue: 0,1:05:32.00,1:05:34.92,Default,,0,0,0,,Consider the naive\Nexponential time algorithm
Dialogue: 0,1:05:34.92,1:05:39.96,Default,,0,0,0,,to evaluate a simple arithmetic\Nterm into a natural number.
Dialogue: 0,1:05:39.96,1:05:41.68,Default,,0,0,0,,So, then here we have a term type
Dialogue: 0,1:05:41.68,1:05:44.88,Default,,0,0,0,,that has two constructors\None and add.
Dialogue: 0,1:05:44.88,1:05:47.08,Default,,0,0,0,,So, we can just evaluate\Nthis into a map
Dialogue: 0,1:05:47.08,1:05:49.52,Default,,0,0,0,,by mapping one to the numeral one,
Dialogue: 0,1:05:49.52,1:05:54.16,Default,,0,0,0,,and by evaluating add t1,\Nt2, by first evaluating t1,
Dialogue: 0,1:05:54.16,1:05:57.48,Default,,0,0,0,,and evaluating t2, and adding\Nthe results together.
Dialogue: 0,1:05:57.48,1:06:01.08,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, we're gonna show how to use\NwithPtrEq the recursive version,
Dialogue: 0,1:06:01.08,1:06:05.00,Default,,0,0,0,,to build a linear-time\Nversion of this algorithm.
Dialogue: 0,1:06:05.00,1:06:07.00,Default,,0,0,0,,We need two additional components,
Dialogue: 0,1:06:07.00,1:06:09.32,Default,,0,0,0,,we need constant-time\Nintrusive hashing,
Dialogue: 0,1:06:09.32,1:06:11.92,Default,,0,0,0,,and we need something that we\Ncall 'sharing the common data'
Dialogue: 0,1:06:11.92,1:06:14.12,Default,,0,0,0,,which I'll discuss shortly.
Dialogue: 0,1:06:14.12,1:06:18.76,Default,,0,0,0,,So, it's almost hard to believe\Nbut even just computing the hash
Dialogue: 0,1:06:18.76,1:06:22.04,Default,,0,0,0,,of a tower requires\Nexponential time.
Dialogue: 0,1:06:22.04,1:06:25.92,Default,,0,0,0,,But hashing, unlike equality,\Nis a unary function.
Dialogue: 0,1:06:25.92,1:06:29.48,Default,,0,0,0,,So, in principal, we can compute it\Nonce and just store it somewhere.
Dialogue: 0,1:06:29.48,1:06:31.40,Default,,0,0,0,,Which brings us to\Nthis folklore trick,
Dialogue: 0,1:06:31.40,1:06:34.12,Default,,0,0,0,,which we call intrusive hashing,
Dialogue: 0,1:06:34.12,1:06:38.40,Default,,0,0,0,,which is to simply extend\Nthe term type itself
Dialogue: 0,1:06:38.40,1:06:40.48,Default,,0,0,0,,to store the hashes of the terms
Dialogue: 0,1:06:40.48,1:06:43.08,Default,,0,0,0,,as extra arguments to\Nthe constructors.
Dialogue: 0,1:06:43.08,1:06:46.60,Default,,0,0,0,,So, here the third argument\Nto add is an adder,
Dialogue: 0,1:06:46.60,1:06:49.84,Default,,0,0,0,,which is just our type that\Nrepresents hashes in this case,
Dialogue: 0,1:06:49.84,1:06:53.48,Default,,0,0,0,,and we can write a fast\Nconstant-time hash function
Dialogue: 0,1:06:53.48,1:06:56.72,Default,,0,0,0,,that simply projects\Nout of this hash field.
Dialogue: 0,1:06:56.72,1:06:59.04,Default,,0,0,0,,And we can write a smart constructor
Dialogue: 0,1:06:59.04,1:07:02.64,Default,,0,0,0,,that internally calls\Nthe built in constructor,
Dialogue: 0,1:07:02.64,1:07:04.84,Default,,0,0,0,,but we'll compute\Nthe hash automatically
Dialogue: 0,1:07:04.84,1:07:08.56,Default,,0,0,0,,using the fast hash on the children.
Dialogue: 0,1:07:08.56,1:07:12.28,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, Lean4 has reference counting\Nand disruptive-updates,
Dialogue: 0,1:07:12.28,1:07:15.36,Default,,0,0,0,,so, we can actually use\Nimperative hash tables
Dialogue: 0,1:07:15.36,1:07:19.24,Default,,0,0,0,,and get the desired expected\Ndig old one lookup times.
Dialogue: 0,1:07:19.24,1:07:21.84,Default,,0,0,0,,But, if your language does\Nnot have this feature,
Dialogue: 0,1:07:21.84,1:07:25.52,Default,,0,0,0,,then you can still use functional\Nor persistent hash tables,
Dialogue: 0,1:07:25.52,1:07:29.40,Default,,0,0,0,,and then all of the same\Nconstructions applied,
Dialogue: 0,1:07:29.40,1:07:34.40,Default,,0,0,0,,but everytime we say linear really\Nmeans quasi-linear for you.
Dialogue: 0,1:07:34.92,1:07:42.52,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, the semi-naive traversal,\Nwe call evalFastEqFastHash.
Dialogue: 0,1:07:42.52,1:07:47.92,Default,,0,0,0,,Which is to use the recursive\NwithPtrEq test for the equality,
Dialogue: 0,1:07:47.96,1:07:51.84,Default,,0,0,0,,and to also cache using\Nthe constant-time
Dialogue: 0,1:07:51.84,1:07:55.08,Default,,0,0,0,,intrusive cache and a hash cache.
Dialogue: 0,1:07:55.08,1:07:58.36,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, this is already linear\Ntime on this example,
Dialogue: 0,1:07:58.36,1:08:01.20,Default,,0,0,0,,strictly because of\Nthe recursive withPtrEq.
Dialogue: 0,1:08:01.20,1:08:03.88,Default,,0,0,0,,And because of\Nthe intrusive hash cache,
Dialogue: 0,1:08:03.88,1:08:09.20,Default,,0,0,0,,is also linear time on this\Nexample, in expectation because,
Dialogue: 0,1:08:09.28,1:08:12.92,Default,,0,0,0,,with high probability the hashes\Nare going to be different,
Dialogue: 0,1:08:12.92,1:08:15.64,Default,,0,0,0,,and in the small chance\Nthat they're the same,
Dialogue: 0,1:08:15.64,1:08:20.52,Default,,0,0,0,,they're very unlikely to be the same\Nagain for the children and so on.
Dialogue: 0,1:08:20.52,1:08:24.20,Default,,0,0,0,,But this semi-naive algorithm
Dialogue: 0,1:08:24.20,1:08:27.16,Default,,0,0,0,,is still exponential\Ntime on this example,
Dialogue: 0,1:08:27.16,1:08:32.32,Default,,0,0,0,,where we have two structurally equal\Nterms that are pointer disjoint.
Dialogue: 0,1:08:32.32,1:08:35.00,Default,,0,0,0,,And this brings us to\Nsharing the common data.
Dialogue: 0,1:08:35.00,1:08:37.52,Default,,0,0,0,,So, with low-level\Npointer manipulations,
Dialogue: 0,1:08:37.52,1:08:41.44,Default,,0,0,0,,we can, quote, 'share\Nthe common data' in linear-time.
Dialogue: 0,1:08:41.44,1:08:45.28,Default,,0,0,0,,And what we mean by that is\Nto take a term like this
Dialogue: 0,1:08:45.28,1:08:49.48,Default,,0,0,0,,that has multiple sub-terms\Nthat are structurally equal,
Dialogue: 0,1:08:49.48,1:08:50.96,Default,,0,0,0,,but pointer disjoint,
Dialogue: 0,1:08:50.96,1:08:55.32,Default,,0,0,0,,and simply share the common\Ndata or contact to the term
Dialogue: 0,1:08:55.32,1:09:00.60,Default,,0,0,0,,and produce the term such that\Nequality implies pointer-equality
Dialogue: 0,1:09:00.68,1:09:03.20,Default,,0,0,0,,of all sub-terms inside the term.
Dialogue: 0,1:09:03.20,1:09:07.28,Default,,0,0,0,,And now in the paper, we\Nintroduce additional primitives
Dialogue: 0,1:09:07.28,1:09:11.00,Default,,0,0,0,,that allow writing pure\Nversions of this procedure
Dialogue: 0,1:09:11.00,1:09:13.48,Default,,0,0,0,,from first principles\Nin linear time.
Dialogue: 0,1:09:13.48,1:09:16.36,Default,,0,0,0,,But, as part of the runtime,
Dialogue: 0,1:09:16.36,1:09:19.68,Default,,0,0,0,,we already have a high performance\Nversion of this procedure
Dialogue: 0,1:09:19.68,1:09:21.80,Default,,0,0,0,,that applies to objects of any type.
Dialogue: 0,1:09:21.80,1:09:25.00,Default,,0,0,0,,So, there's no additional trust\Nrequired to simply expose it.
Dialogue: 0,1:09:25.00,1:09:28.96,Default,,0,0,0,,So, we present a new\Nprimitive shareCommon
Dialogue: 0,1:09:28.96,1:09:31.64,Default,,0,0,0,,that is just the identity function
Dialogue: 0,1:09:31.64,1:09:34.96,Default,,0,0,0,,whose reference implementation\Nis just the identity function,
Dialogue: 0,1:09:34.96,1:09:37.32,Default,,0,0,0,,it actually takes no\Nadditional preconditions.
Dialogue: 0,1:09:37.32,1:09:38.52,Default,,0,0,0,,But under the hood,
Dialogue: 0,1:09:38.52,1:09:41.52,Default,,0,0,0,,it's going to share the common\N- use the runtime support
Dialogue: 0,1:09:41.52,1:09:45.20,Default,,0,0,0,,to share the common data inside x.
Dialogue: 0,1:09:45.20,1:09:49.12,Default,,0,0,0,,And finally, we have a robust\Nlinear-time traversal,
Dialogue: 0,1:09:49.12,1:09:52.24,Default,,0,0,0,,which we are - to be\Noverly pedantic,
Dialogue: 0,1:09:52.24,1:09:57.04,Default,,0,0,0,,call evalFastEqFastHashShareCommon,\Nand the idea is simple,
Dialogue: 0,1:09:57.04,1:10:00.80,Default,,0,0,0,,we first share the common data\Nwhich takes linear-time,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:00.80,1:10:03.76,Default,,0,0,0,,and then we call evalFastEqFastHash,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:03.76,1:10:08.92,Default,,0,0,0,,which is linear-time as long as\Nthe data is being maximally shared.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:09.60,1:10:12.00,Default,,0,0,0,,And our motto in general\Nis if terms are equal,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:12.00,1:10:14.00,Default,,0,0,0,,they should be pointer-equal,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:14.00,1:10:17.36,Default,,0,0,0,,and they will definitely be\Npointer-equal after shareCommon.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:17.44,1:10:21.20,Default,,0,0,0,,And if terms are not equal,\Ntheir constant-time hashes
Dialogue: 0,1:10:21.20,1:10:24.36,Default,,0,0,0,,should not be equal\Nwith high probability.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:24.36,1:10:27.16,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, the paper covers\Nmany extensions
Dialogue: 0,1:10:27.16,1:10:29.36,Default,,0,0,0,,and alternatives to this approach.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:29.36,1:10:31.96,Default,,0,0,0,,I'll go through a couple\Nexamples very briefly.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:31.96,1:10:34.56,Default,,0,0,0,,So, we can have\Na pointer equality test
Dialogue: 0,1:10:34.56,1:10:37.56,Default,,0,0,0,,without requiring\Nreflexivity as follows.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:37.56,1:10:42.12,Default,,0,0,0,,Here's a primitive withPtrEqResult\Nthat takes two terms x and y.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:42.12,1:10:44.16,Default,,0,0,0,,And instead of a thunk, k,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:44.16,1:10:47.28,Default,,0,0,0,,it's a continuation that gets\Nto see an optional proof
Dialogue: 0,1:10:47.28,1:10:48.72,Default,,0,0,0,,that x equals y.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:48.72,1:10:50.44,Default,,0,0,0,,But instead of returning a Bool in,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:50.44,1:10:53.56,Default,,0,0,0,,it returns an element\Nof any type beta.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:53.56,1:10:55.12,Default,,0,0,0,,And now the precondition we need
Dialogue: 0,1:10:55.12,1:10:57.48,Default,,0,0,0,,is that no matter what\Nproof we give it,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:57.48,1:10:59.16,Default,,0,0,0,,or what optional proof we give it,
Dialogue: 0,1:10:59.16,1:11:02.08,Default,,0,0,0,,this continuation is gonna\Nreturn the same value.
Dialogue: 0,1:11:02.08,1:11:06.04,Default,,0,0,0,,And the reference implementation\Njust calls it on none.
Dialogue: 0,1:11:06.04,1:11:09.08,Default,,0,0,0,,But at runtime, if x\Nand y are pointer-equal,
Dialogue: 0,1:11:09.08,1:11:12.20,Default,,0,0,0,,we call it with\Nthe proof of reflexivity.
Dialogue: 0,1:11:12.20,1:11:16.60,Default,,0,0,0,,And we can also support direct\Npointer address manipulation
Dialogue: 0,1:11:16.60,1:11:19.56,Default,,0,0,0,,with the new primitive withPtrAddr,
Dialogue: 0,1:11:19.56,1:11:23.52,Default,,0,0,0,,which takes a term x whose\Naddress we wanna inspect
Dialogue: 0,1:11:23.52,1:11:28.56,Default,,0,0,0,,and it takes a continuation, k, that\Nis going to look at that address
Dialogue: 0,1:11:28.56,1:11:32.00,Default,,0,0,0,,and again, return an element\Nof an arbitrary type beta.
Dialogue: 0,1:11:32.00,1:11:33.88,Default,,0,0,0,,And the precondition we need here
Dialogue: 0,1:11:33.88,1:11:38.92,Default,,0,0,0,,is that no matter what address we\Ngive k, k returns the same value.
Dialogue: 0,1:11:38.92,1:11:40.96,Default,,0,0,0,,And then the reference\Nimplementation
Dialogue: 0,1:11:40.96,1:11:45.00,Default,,0,0,0,,just evaluates k at\Nan arbitrary value, zero,
Dialogue: 0,1:11:45.00,1:11:49.32,Default,,0,0,0,,whereas the optimized\Nversion will evaluate k
Dialogue: 0,1:11:49.32,1:11:51.68,Default,,0,0,0,,on the actual memory address of x.
Dialogue: 0,1:11:51.68,1:11:55.84,Default,,0,0,0,,And the proof very\Ntrivially implies that
Dialogue: 0,1:11:55.84,1:12:00.24,Default,,0,0,0,,the optimized version is\Nfunctionally indistinguishable
Dialogue: 0,1:12:00.24,1:12:02.72,Default,,0,0,0,,from the pure reference\Nimplementation.
Dialogue: 0,1:12:02.72,1:12:05.40,Default,,0,0,0,,Perhaps the surprising\Npart of this is that
Dialogue: 0,1:12:05.40,1:12:07.80,Default,,0,0,0,,this precondition\Nisn't too restrictive.
Dialogue: 0,1:12:07.80,1:12:10.28,Default,,0,0,0,,And we show in the paper\Nthat indeed we can do

Dialogue: 0,1:12:14.84,1:12:18.60,Default,,0,0,0,,And in fact, combining\NwithPtrEqResult and withPtrAddr,
Dialogue: 0,1:12:18.60,1:12:22.16,Default,,0,0,0,,we can implement pointer\Ncaches, reverse principals,
Dialogue: 0,1:12:22.16,1:12:26.40,Default,,0,0,0,,and we can implement shareCommon\Nreverse principals, and so forth.

Dialogue: 0,1:29:58.64,1:30:01.52,Default,,0,0,0,,And the problem is essentially\Nthat logical relations
Dialogue: 0,1:30:01.52,1:30:04.12,Default,,0,0,0,,are just more natural to use
Dialogue: 0,1:30:04.12,1:30:07.56,Default,,0,0,0,,to reason about how\Na program produces an output,
Dialogue: 0,1:30:07.60,1:30:11.44,Default,,0,0,0,,than how it uses its input.
Dialogue: 0,1:30:11.44,1:30:13.60,Default,,0,0,0,,So let's look at a particular value
Dialogue: 0,1:30:13.60,1:30:16.92,Default,,0,0,0,,of this existential type.
Dialogue: 0,1:30:16.92,1:30:20.28,Default,,0,0,0,,And let's look at how these\Nvalues of this type are used.
Dialogue: 0,1:30:20.28,1:30:22.72,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, we used existential types\Nby pattern matching on them
Dialogue: 0,1:30:22.72,1:30:23.72,Default,,0,0,0,,to unpack them.
Dialogue: 0,1:30:23.72,1:30:27.76,Default,,0,0,0,,And here we unpack this\Nexistential into a function Y
Dialogue: 0,1:30:27.76,1:30:29.28,Default,,0,0,0,,and this Y is a high order function.
Dialogue: 0,1:30:29.28,1:30:32.32,Default,,0,0,0,,So we pass another function\NF as input into it.
Dialogue: 0,1:30:32.32,1:30:35.56,Default,,0,0,0,,And F has the type X arrow X,
Dialogue: 0,1:30:35.56,1:30:39.24,Default,,0,0,0,,but this X type is an abstract type.
Dialogue: 0,1:30:39.24,1:30:41.96,Default,,0,0,0,,And so F must be\Nthe identity function.
Dialogue: 0,1:30:41.96,1:30:44.08,Default,,0,0,0,,So with that in mind, let's\Nlook at these two values
Dialogue: 0,1:30:44.08,1:30:46.28,Default,,0,0,0,,of the same existential type.
Dialogue: 0,1:30:46.28,1:30:49.48,Default,,0,0,0,,They contain functions\Nthat themselves
Dialogue: 0,1:30:49.48,1:30:51.92,Default,,0,0,0,,take another function as input F
Dialogue: 0,1:30:51.92,1:30:55.68,Default,,0,0,0,,and they both apply F to\Nmany different values,
Dialogue: 0,1:30:55.68,1:30:58.40,Default,,0,0,0,,checking to see that it does indeed
Dialogue: 0,1:30:58.40,1:31:00.84,Default,,0,0,0,,behave as the identity function.
Dialogue: 0,1:31:00.84,1:31:04.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Since we've already\Nshown that this is true,
Dialogue: 0,1:31:04.00,1:31:07.16,Default,,0,0,0,,we can look at\Nthe functions in these packages
Dialogue: 0,1:31:07.16,1:31:10.16,Default,,0,0,0,,and confirm that they both are\Nalways going to return true,
Dialogue: 0,1:31:10.16,1:31:12.32,Default,,0,0,0,,no matter what.
Dialogue: 0,1:31:12.32,1:31:15.52,Default,,0,0,0,,So, in other words, this means\Nthat they must be equivalent.
Dialogue: 0,1:31:15.52,1:31:17.20,Default,,0,0,0,,But logical relations\Nin bisimulations
Dialogue: 0,1:31:17.20,1:31:19.52,Default,,0,0,0,,struggle to prove this\Nbecause they force you
Dialogue: 0,1:31:19.56,1:31:22.60,Default,,0,0,0,,to come up with some relational\Ninterpretation for X
Dialogue: 0,1:31:22.60,1:31:26.00,Default,,0,0,0,,that somehow relates\Nvalues of Boolean type
Dialogue: 0,1:31:26.00,1:31:28.04,Default,,0,0,0,,to values of Integer type.
Dialogue: 0,1:31:28.04,1:31:31.08,Default,,0,0,0,,But we have no such\Nrelation in mind here.
Dialogue: 0,1:31:31.08,1:31:36.72,Default,,0,0,0,,There's not really a correspondence\Nbetween the values of X
Dialogue: 0,1:31:36.72,1:31:37.72,Default,,0,0,0,,in one of these packages
Dialogue: 0,1:31:37.72,1:31:40.52,Default,,0,0,0,,with values of X in\Nthe other package.
Dialogue: 0,1:31:41.32,1:31:42.32,Default,,0,0,0,,So instead, what we want to do
Dialogue: 0,1:31:42.32,1:31:45.68,Default,,0,0,0,,is look at the possible context\Nthese values may be used in
Dialogue: 0,1:31:45.68,1:31:48.64,Default,,0,0,0,,and exploit the fact that\Nthey're constrained
Dialogue: 0,1:31:48.64,1:31:50.48,Default,,0,0,0,,by their types.
Dialogue: 0,1:31:50.48,1:31:51.76,Default,,0,0,0,,So throughout the rest of the talk,
Dialogue: 0,1:31:51.76,1:31:54.44,Default,,0,0,0,,we're going to look at\Na proof theoretic technique
Dialogue: 0,1:31:54.44,1:31:57.00,Default,,0,0,0,,called focusing and show\Nthat that's actually useful
Dialogue: 0,1:31:57.00,1:31:58.64,Default,,0,0,0,,for reasoning about programs.
Dialogue: 0,1:31:58.64,1:32:02.24,Default,,0,0,0,,In fact, we can use that to\Nprove this equivalence.
Dialogue: 0,1:32:02.24,1:32:04.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Lastly, we'll see why this\Ntechnique might be useful
Dialogue: 0,1:32:04.80,1:32:06.92,Default,,0,0,0,,in compositional\Ncompiler correctness.
Dialogue: 0,1:32:06.92,1:32:08.48,Default,,0,0,0,,For this talk, we're\Ngonna deal with
Dialogue: 0,1:32:08.48,1:32:11.36,Default,,0,0,0,,a call by value language\Nwith predicative polymorphism
Dialogue: 0,1:32:11.36,1:32:12.36,Default,,0,0,0,,in a pure setting,
Dialogue: 0,1:32:12.36,1:32:15.60,Default,,0,0,0,,but the paper goes beyond\Nsome of these restrictions.
Dialogue: 0,1:32:15.60,1:32:16.88,Default,,0,0,0,,So what is focusing?
Dialogue: 0,1:32:16.88,1:32:19.32,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, focusing is\Na proof search technique
Dialogue: 0,1:32:19.32,1:32:21.40,Default,,0,0,0,,that narrows down the search space
Dialogue: 0,1:32:21.40,1:32:24.00,Default,,0,0,0,,when you're trying to find\Na proof of a certain proposition.
Dialogue: 0,1:32:24.00,1:32:25.64,Default,,0,0,0,,And viewed through\Nthe lens of Curry Howard,
Dialogue: 0,1:32:25.64,1:32:27.56,Default,,0,0,0,,you can think of it as\Nmaking things easier
Dialogue: 0,1:32:27.56,1:32:30.00,Default,,0,0,0,,when you're trying to synthesize\Na program of a given.
Dialogue: 0,1:32:30.76,1:32:32.52,Default,,0,0,0,,So how does focusing\Nnarrow down the search space?
Dialogue: 0,1:32:32.52,1:32:35.88,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, it does that by visiting\Nfewer redundant terms
Dialogue: 0,1:32:35.88,1:32:40.80,Default,,0,0,0,,that are just equivalent to each\Nother via beta or eta laws.
Dialogue: 0,1:32:40.80,1:32:43.28,Default,,0,0,0,,We don't have time to go into\Nfocusing in depth today
Dialogue: 0,1:32:43.56,1:32:44.84,Default,,0,0,0,,but I wanted to give you a flavor
Dialogue: 0,1:32:44.84,1:32:47.76,Default,,0,0,0,,of what focused terms look like.
Dialogue: 0,1:32:47.76,1:32:50.60,Default,,0,0,0,,So let's try and visit\Nall the focused programs
Dialogue: 0,1:32:50.60,1:32:53.96,Default,,0,0,0,,of Boolean to Boolean type.
Dialogue: 0,1:32:53.96,1:32:56.16,Default,,0,0,0,,The first thing that\Nfocusing says we can do
Dialogue: 0,1:32:56.16,1:32:58.60,Default,,0,0,0,,is apply the lambda type constructor
Dialogue: 0,1:32:58.60,1:33:01.24,Default,,0,0,0,,anytime we have a function\Non the right hand side.
Dialogue: 0,1:33:01.24,1:33:04.40,Default,,0,0,0,,So that just any term in our\Nlanguage of function type
Dialogue: 0,1:33:04.40,1:33:06.68,Default,,0,0,0,,is going to be equivalent\Nto sum lambda.
Dialogue: 0,1:33:06.68,1:33:09.44,Default,,0,0,0,,And that's true by\Neta in call by name
Dialogue: 0,1:33:09.44,1:33:11.92,Default,,0,0,0,,and in call by value we're\Nalso using normalization.
Dialogue: 0,1:33:11.92,1:33:13.96,Default,,0,0,0,,But if you didn't have normalization
Dialogue: 0,1:33:13.96,1:33:15.72,Default,,0,0,0,,you could still use this technique
Dialogue: 0,1:33:15.72,1:33:20.36,Default,,0,0,0,,you would just have an extra non-terminating\Nterm to consider.
Dialogue: 0,1:33:20.36,1:33:21.84,Default,,0,0,0,,So now we need to consider
Dialogue: 0,1:33:21.84,1:33:24.20,Default,,0,0,0,,what the body of\Nthe lambda might be.
Dialogue: 0,1:33:24.20,1:33:26.00,Default,,0,0,0,,And when we're trying to build that
Dialogue: 0,1:33:26.00,1:33:28.16,Default,,0,0,0,,focusing says that\Nthe first thing we can do
Dialogue: 0,1:33:28.16,1:33:29.76,Default,,0,0,0,,is eagerly pattern match.
Dialogue: 0,1:33:29.76,1:33:31.52,Default,,0,0,0,,Anytime there's\Nsomething in the context
Dialogue: 0,1:33:31.52,1:33:33.24,Default,,0,0,0,,that can be pattern matched on
Dialogue: 0,1:33:33.24,1:33:34.44,Default,,0,0,0,,focusing says we might as well
Dialogue: 0,1:33:34.44,1:33:36.04,Default,,0,0,0,,do that pattern matching right now,
Dialogue: 0,1:33:36.04,1:33:38.44,Default,,0,0,0,,there's no point\Nwaiting until later.
Dialogue: 0,1:33:38.44,1:33:41.12,Default,,0,0,0,,So now we know that all\Nthe terms we're interested in
Dialogue: 0,1:33:41.12,1:33:42.88,Default,,0,0,0,,have a lambda on the outside
Dialogue: 0,1:33:42.88,1:33:46.68,Default,,0,0,0,,and then immediately pattern\Nmatch on it's input.
Dialogue: 0,1:33:46.68,1:33:48.80,Default,,0,0,0,,And what we're left to\Nbuild are the two branches
Dialogue: 0,1:33:48.80,1:33:49.80,Default,,0,0,0,,of the if statement.
Dialogue: 0,1:33:49.80,1:33:50.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Both of these are closed
Dialogue: 0,1:33:50.80,1:33:52.56,Default,,0,0,0,,because focusing knows\Nthat there's no point
Dialogue: 0,1:33:52.56,1:33:56.24,Default,,0,0,0,,in pattern matching on x twice\Nonce we've already done it.
Dialogue: 0,1:33:56.24,1:33:58.92,Default,,0,0,0,,And so we just need to\Nbuild focused programs
Dialogue: 0,1:33:58.92,1:34:00.00,Default,,0,0,0,,of Boolean type.
Dialogue: 0,1:34:00.00,1:34:02.00,Default,,0,0,0,,And it turns out there\Nare only two of those,
Dialogue: 0,1:34:02.00,1:34:03.60,Default,,0,0,0,,true and false.
Dialogue: 0,1:34:03.60,1:34:05.36,Default,,0,0,0,,And so we can use those to build
Dialogue: 0,1:34:05.36,1:34:07.16,Default,,0,0,0,,our four candidate programs here
Dialogue: 0,1:34:07.16,1:34:09.88,Default,,0,0,0,,and turns out that every function\Nof Boolean to Boolean type
Dialogue: 0,1:34:09.88,1:34:11.88,Default,,0,0,0,,needs to be equivalent to
Dialogue: 0,1:34:11.88,1:34:14.04,Default,,0,0,0,,one of these four focused programs.
Dialogue: 0,1:34:14.04,1:34:16.28,Default,,0,0,0,,We've cut out many, many\Nnon-focused programs
Dialogue: 0,1:34:16.28,1:34:19.48,Default,,0,0,0,,such as the identity\Nfunction lambda x.x
Dialogue: 0,1:34:19.48,1:34:21.08,Default,,0,0,0,,but this program is\Nstill represented
Dialogue: 0,1:34:21.08,1:34:25.16,Default,,0,0,0,,in the second bullet point here.
Dialogue: 0,1:34:25.16,1:34:28.12,Default,,0,0,0,,So some properties of focused\Nterms to keep in mind
Dialogue: 0,1:34:28.12,1:34:30.60,Default,,0,0,0,,are that focused terms are\Nalways beta eta normal.
Dialogue: 0,1:34:30.60,1:34:32.52,Default,,0,0,0,,There's no way to beta reduce them
Dialogue: 0,1:34:32.52,1:34:37.68,Default,,0,0,0,,and they can't be eta expanded\Nwithout introducing a redex.
Dialogue: 0,1:34:37.68,1:34:40.96,Default,,0,0,0,,And we characterize\Nthem in our paper
Dialogue: 0,1:34:41.08,1:34:43.08,Default,,0,0,0,,as a restricted type system.
Dialogue: 0,1:34:43.08,1:34:46.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Basically, the usual type\Nrules that you're used to
Dialogue: 0,1:34:46.20,1:34:49.20,Default,,0,0,0,,but restricted to be\Napplied in a certain order
Dialogue: 0,1:34:49.20,1:34:51.04,Default,,0,0,0,,and this gives you strong\Ninversion principles
Dialogue: 0,1:34:51.40,1:34:54.60,Default,,0,0,0,,to do programmatic reasoning.
Dialogue: 0,1:34:54.60,1:34:57.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Lastly, for every focused term,
Dialogue: 0,1:34:57.00,1:34:58.32,Default,,0,0,0,,for every well typed term,
Dialogue: 0,1:34:58.32,1:35:00.28,Default,,0,0,0,,there's some equivalent\Nfocused term.
Dialogue: 0,1:35:00.28,1:35:02.28,Default,,0,0,0,,This is called\Ncomputational completeness
Dialogue: 0,1:35:02.28,1:35:03.84,Default,,0,0,0,,and it's the key property we need
Dialogue: 0,1:35:03.84,1:35:05.52,Default,,0,0,0,,for reasoning about programs
Dialogue: 0,1:35:05.52,1:35:07.16,Default,,0,0,0,,and basically all it says is that
Dialogue: 0,1:35:07.44,1:35:10.88,Default,,0,0,0,,we may have eliminated many\Nredundant representations
Dialogue: 0,1:35:10.88,1:35:13.64,Default,,0,0,0,,of the same program but we\Nhaven't lost anything of value,
Dialogue: 0,1:35:13.64,1:35:16.20,Default,,0,0,0,,there's still some\Nrepresentative focus program
Dialogue: 0,1:35:16.20,1:35:18.80,Default,,0,0,0,,for any other program.
Dialogue: 0,1:35:18.80,1:35:21.44,Default,,0,0,0,,So why are we talking about\Na proof search technique
Dialogue: 0,1:35:21.44,1:35:24.32,Default,,0,0,0,,in a talk about\Ncontextual equivalence?
Dialogue: 0,1:35:24.32,1:35:27.56,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, it turns out that a proof\Nof contextual equivalence
Dialogue: 0,1:35:27.56,1:35:31.12,Default,,0,0,0,,is just a search through\Nall possible contexts
Dialogue: 0,1:35:31.12,1:35:34.16,Default,,0,0,0,,demonstrating the same\Nbehavior for each context.
Dialogue: 0,1:35:34.16,1:35:35.68,Default,,0,0,0,,And so if you think\Nabout it like this
Dialogue: 0,1:35:35.68,1:35:37.64,Default,,0,0,0,,and you apply\Nthe completeness of focusing
Dialogue: 0,1:35:37.64,1:35:40.28,Default,,0,0,0,,then you can see that\Nthere's no need
Dialogue: 0,1:35:40.28,1:35:42.08,Default,,0,0,0,,to search through all\Npossible contexts,
Dialogue: 0,1:35:42.40,1:35:46.20,Default,,0,0,0,,you only need to search\Nthrough focused contexts.
Dialogue: 0,1:35:46.20,1:35:48.28,Default,,0,0,0,,So that leads us to\Na context dilemma
Dialogue: 0,1:35:48.28,1:35:49.36,Default,,0,0,0,,which looks a little hairy
Dialogue: 0,1:35:49.36,1:35:50.92,Default,,0,0,0,,but all this is saying is that
Dialogue: 0,1:35:50.92,1:35:52.92,Default,,0,0,0,,to prove two values equivalent
Dialogue: 0,1:35:52.92,1:35:55.76,Default,,0,0,0,,you only need to consider\Nfocused contexts
Dialogue: 0,1:35:55.76,1:35:58.28,Default,,0,0,0,,which are represented\Nby a term, an f,
Dialogue: 0,1:35:58.28,1:36:01.80,Default,,0,0,0,,with a whole x represented\Nas a variable here.
Dialogue: 0,1:36:01.80,1:36:05.40,Default,,0,0,0,,And if v1 and v2 are open then\Nyou need to close them off
Dialogue: 0,1:36:05.40,1:36:07.16,Default,,0,0,0,,with some closing substitutions
Dialogue: 0,1:36:07.16,1:36:09.08,Default,,0,0,0,,but you can assume\Nthat all the values
Dialogue: 0,1:36:09.08,1:36:13.04,Default,,0,0,0,,in those substitutions are focused.
Dialogue: 0,1:36:13.04,1:36:14.40,Default,,0,0,0,,So let's return to the equivalence
Dialogue: 0,1:36:14.40,1:36:16.08,Default,,0,0,0,,that we wanted to prove earlier.
Dialogue: 0,1:36:16.08,1:36:18.72,Default,,0,0,0,,And now we'll apply\Nour focusing loma.
Dialogue: 0,1:36:18.72,1:36:21.96,Default,,0,0,0,,And this context loma says,\Nsince these values are closed,
Dialogue: 0,1:36:21.96,1:36:23.92,Default,,0,0,0,,we just need to consider\Nsome context NF
Dialogue: 0,1:36:23.92,1:36:26.12,Default,,0,0,0,,and show that they\Nboth behave the same
Dialogue: 0,1:36:26.12,1:36:31.52,Default,,0,0,0,,when the values are filled in for X.
Dialogue: 0,1:36:31.52,1:36:36.36,Default,,0,0,0,,So what does the fact that\NNF is focused tell us?
Dialogue: 0,1:36:36.36,1:36:41.68,Default,,0,0,0,,Well the whole in NF X\Nhas existential type,
Dialogue: 0,1:36:41.68,1:36:42.88,Default,,0,0,0,,and we know that existential types
Dialogue: 0,1:36:42.88,1:36:44.28,Default,,0,0,0,,can be pattern matched on.
Dialogue: 0,1:36:44.28,1:36:47.92,Default,,0,0,0,,So focusing says let's\Ndo that right away.
Dialogue: 0,1:36:47.92,1:36:50.24,Default,,0,0,0,,Now once we unpack the existential,
Dialogue: 0,1:36:50.24,1:36:52.20,Default,,0,0,0,,we get this function Y,
Dialogue: 0,1:36:52.20,1:36:55.28,Default,,0,0,0,,and the rest of the body\Nof the pattern
Dialogue: 0,1:36:55.28,1:36:58.28,Default,,0,0,0,,after each statement gets to\Ncall Y potentially.
Dialogue: 0,1:36:58.28,1:36:59.96,Default,,0,0,0,,So there's really only two\Nthings that we can do here,
Dialogue: 0,1:36:59.96,1:37:02.88,Default,,0,0,0,,either we call Y or we\Ndon't, and if we don't,
Dialogue: 0,1:37:02.88,1:37:07.36,Default,,0,0,0,,then we can only return\Na constant bullion value.
Dialogue: 0,1:37:07.36,1:37:09.12,Default,,0,0,0,,So there are three possible shapes

Dialogue: 0,1:50:22.32,1:50:27.40,Default,,0,0,0,,serves the GC collector from\NMarlow and Peyton Jones, 2011.
Dialogue: 0,1:50:29.96,1:50:31.88,Default,,0,0,0,,So this particular\Ndesign has an invariant
Dialogue: 0,1:50:31.88,1:50:36.08,Default,,0,0,0,,that there are no pointers\Nbetween two minor heaps.
Dialogue: 0,1:50:36.08,1:50:37.44,Default,,0,0,0,,And this allows each domain

Dialogue: 0,1:50:41.80,1:50:45.32,Default,,0,0,0,,And unlike the original\NDialogue lever design,
Dialogue: 0,1:50:45.32,1:50:49.16,Default,,0,0,0,,we are low pointers from\Nthe major to the minor heap.
Dialogue: 0,1:50:49.16,1:50:51.72,Default,,0,0,0,,And the reason why we\Nallow this is two fold.
Dialogue: 0,1:50:51.72,1:50:55.92,Default,,0,0,0,,First, it prevents\Neager promotion, right?
Dialogue: 0,1:50:55.92,1:50:58.28,Default,,0,0,0,,So early promotion is\Na problem where you point

Dialogue: 0,1:51:05.84,1:51:08.32,Default,,0,0,0,,and this also mirrors\Nsequential behaviour
Dialogue: 0,1:51:09.08,1:51:11.84,Default,,0,0,0,,and unfortunately, what this does is
Dialogue: 0,1:51:12.32,1:51:14.80,Default,,0,0,0,,a particular domain\Nmay follow a pointer
Dialogue: 0,1:51:14.80,1:51:16.52,Default,,0,0,0,,from the major to the minor heap
Dialogue: 0,1:51:16.52,1:51:18.44,Default,,0,0,0,,to remote minor heap.
Dialogue: 0,1:51:19.20,1:51:21.48,Default,,0,0,0,,And this will break\Nthe invariant that we had.
Dialogue: 0,1:51:22.00,1:51:24.60,Default,,0,0,0,,So, what we need to do is\Ninsert a read barrier

Dialogue: 0,1:51:27.32,1:51:31.00,Default,,0,0,0,,which detects whether the result\Nof the read is going to be

Dialogue: 0,1:51:45.12,1:51:47.16,Default,,0,0,0,,And then, the execution proceeds.
Dialogue: 0,1:51:48.44,1:51:53.92,Default,,0,0,0,,Recall that I had mentioned that\NOCaml does not have read barriers
Dialogue: 0,1:51:53.92,1:51:56.36,Default,,0,0,0,,and now, this design has\Ninterviews read barriers.
Dialogue: 0,1:51:56.36,1:51:59.52,Default,,0,0,0,,So, the first challenge is that we\Nneed these read barriers to be

Dialogue: 0,1:52:03.88,1:52:06.24,Default,,0,0,0,,And in the paper, we showed\Nthat we can do this

Dialogue: 0,1:52:16.72,1:52:19.84,Default,,0,0,0,,And the proof of correctness of\Nthis is available in the paper.
Dialogue: 0,1:52:20.64,1:52:21.64,Default,,0,0,0,,And the...
Dialogue: 0,1:52:22.32,1:52:23.84,Default,,0,0,0,,Because this
Dialogue: 0,1:52:24.44,1:52:26.20,Default,,0,0,0,,(INAUDIBLE) are going to be sorted.
Dialogue: 0,1:52:26.20,1:52:28.52,Default,,0,0,0,,The branch corrector correctly\Npredicts the branch

Dialogue: 0,1:52:30.88,1:52:32.88,Default,,0,0,0,,So, the performance impact of
Dialogue: 0,1:52:32.88,1:52:35.52,Default,,0,0,0,,these additional instructions is\Nminimal on sequential code.
Dialogue: 0,1:52:36.72,1:52:39.60,Default,,0,0,0,,Unfortunately though,\Nthe introduction of the read barriers
Dialogue: 0,1:52:39.60,1:52:41.00,Default,,0,0,0,,breaks the C API.
Dialogue: 0,1:52:41.96,1:52:43.80,Default,,0,0,0,,And check out this example where
Dialogue: 0,1:52:43.80,1:52:46.80,Default,,0,0,0,,we have two domains, each\Nof which is reading
Dialogue: 0,1:52:46.80,1:52:50.68,Default,,0,0,0,,a major heap object which\Npoints to the other domain.
Dialogue: 0,1:52:51.32,1:52:53.28,Default,,0,0,0,,So, at this point, this domain
Dialogue: 0,1:52:53.80,1:52:58.12,Default,,0,0,0,,sends a promotion request\Nto the other domain.
Dialogue: 0,1:52:58.48,1:53:00.84,Default,,0,0,0,,So, the two domains simultaneously\Nsend promotion requests
Dialogue: 0,1:53:01.32,1:53:03.76,Default,,0,0,0,,and in order to prevent that\Nlock and make progress,
Dialogue: 0,1:53:03.76,1:53:06.28,Default,,0,0,0,,when the domain sends\Na promotion request,
Dialogue: 0,1:53:06.32,1:53:09.00,Default,,0,0,0,,it has to keep servicing\Nother promotion requests
Dialogue: 0,1:53:09.00,1:53:10.56,Default,,0,0,0,,that it may receive.
Dialogue: 0,1:53:11.44,1:53:15.24,Default,,0,0,0,,So, the issue is that because\Npromotion may involve
Dialogue: 0,1:53:15.96,1:53:18.48,Default,,0,0,0,,a minor collection,
Dialogue: 0,1:53:19.16,1:53:23.08,Default,,0,0,0,,a mutable read is in fact a GC\Nsafe point where GC may happen.

Dialogue: 0,1:53:39.24,1:53:40.84,Default,,0,0,0,,And introducing

Dialogue: 0,1:53:45.40,1:53:50.08,Default,,0,0,0,,will require manually\Nrefactoring very tricky code.
Dialogue: 0,1:53:52.80,1:53:54.52,Default,,0,0,0,,And this is unfortunate.
Dialogue: 0,1:53:54.96,1:53:56.44,Default,,0,0,0,,So, in order to
Dialogue: 0,1:53:56.80,1:54:00.92,Default,,0,0,0,,get around this, we also implement\Nthe parallel minor collector
